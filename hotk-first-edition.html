had taken only a matter of hours for the Kethlan system to become a
tumbling sea of debris; the twisted and burnt-out remnants of a once
glorious Imperial nation. An empire whose costly mistakes would for
many years to come echo into every corner of the known galaxy. And
with those mistakes would come death to billions of innocent,
unsuspecting lives.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
A starfighter hurtled
through the scattered metal, the pilot desperate to find a way to
stop himself from joining the ever growing population of this
interstellar graveyard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Jacques Chalmers was
not alone in his frustration with the current situation, but he was
doubtless one of the most panicked. He tried to steady himself as he
began cycling once again through the available display options for
his starfighter's radar
system. His anxiety continued to grow with each passing second, every
change of the screen doing nothing to abate it. He stopped midway
through the calibration and glanced out of his cockpit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The scene was the same
as it had been a few moments ago and it brought him no comfort. He
couldn't count the number of capital ships that dominated the Enemy's
frontline. Twenty? Thirty? Fifty? In his years of service to the
Imperial Naval Forces he had never seen anything like it, not even in
archive war footage. The enormous forms of the battleships loomed
like giants atop a hill, staring down upon a tiny village below. Then
there were the Enemy starfighters themselves: hundreds at least,
swarming about like a huge wall of locusts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Knowing that he had
already been flying straight for longer than was advisable, Chalmers
altered his course to attempt to throw off any pursuers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">

<P CLASS="western">
Not long before he had
been standing on the flight deck of his deployment carrier, amongst
the other pilots, his heart pumping in his ears, his hands sweating
as he awaited the order to board his fighter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chalmers saw his
friends run forward as their names were called out, scrambling into
cockpits, pulling on helmets and performing last-minute safety
checks. Though most hid it well, he was convinced they were all as
nervous and scared as he was - knowing they could well be speeding
only to their own deaths. As he watched his friends'
fighters hurtle down the catapult, his commanding officer had
addressed the last remaining pilots still standing on the flight
deck.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Right, listen up,”
he started. “This is where we must make our stand. The Enemy cannot
be allowed to advance any further. Tonight we fight the battle for
Kethlan and for the Imperium; the battle for our survival. Hundreds
of millions of lives are depending on our actions here. Make them
proud!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>Hundreds</I><I>
of millions?</I> thought Chalmers. <I>Is
that all that</I><I>'</I><I>s
left? A few months ago it was billions.</I> This day
had crept ever closer as cities, planets and then entire star systems
had fallen to the Enemy; to those damned Pandorans; to the Senate's
mistake. How many of his friends had he lost over these last few
terrible months? Had they died fast or were they now suffering a fate
far worse..?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As his CO continued to
pump them up for the critical battle, Chalmers'
head was filled with visions of row upon row of black-clad soldiers.
A white emblem resided on their right arms and left breast, an
all-encompassing full black helmet upon their heads, its smooth form
negating all facial features. Two bright red oval spheres were set
into an eye-level groove that ran all around, the “eyes”
themselves slanted into a menacing and intimidating scowl. One of the
soldiers turned to face him, the ruby-like eyes seeming to pierce his
very soul. He felt his hand tighten on the flight helmet he held,
swallowing hard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Daniels! Peterson!
Foster! Brown! Rye...” a voice called out above the other sounds
that filled the flight deck. Feet moved and Chalmers felt his stomach
lurch. His name would be called soon. He felt a sense of doom. If the
Empire could not stop the Enemy before, what hope did they have now?
The Enemy's power had grown
exponentially and they had crushed everything in their path with
harrowing little effort. Chalmers was feeling forced to accept the
truth: they were all that was left of the Imperial Naval Forces. This
was a battle that could not be won; not now, not ever.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“... Tyler! Flynn!
Chalmers! King! Golden! Blair...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
At the sound of his
name, Chalmers felt himself move robotically, his mind screaming in
protest against what his legs were doing. He ran over to the waiting
starfighter, threw on his helmet and begun ascending the ladder into
the cockpit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Zombie-like he sank
down into the seat, watching as if from outside his body as his hands
buckled him in, his fingers flip switches, press buttons, acknowledge
questions and confirmations on the screens before him. Moments later,
his craft was taxied to the catapult and before long he'd found
himself out in space and into the thick of battle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
At that moment, his
worst fears had not only been altogether realised, but far exceeded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">

Chalmers cancelled the
radar calibration screen and instead opened a communications channel
to his parent carrier.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>Centaur</I>,
this is First Lieutenant Chalmers.” He could hear the fear and
tension in his own voice as he spoke and could not control it. “Has
there been any update to the radar situation?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That's
a negative, Chalmers, we're
still working on it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>Centaur</I>'s
answer did nothing to ease his distress. “Any contingency plans? I
can't see what the hell I'm
supposed to be shooting at out here!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Again, that's
a negative. Ops believes that enemy craft are masking their vessel
signatures. We're working to
decode it ASAP. We will keep you notified. <I>Centaur</I>
out.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chalmers again looked
down at his radar screen in frustration. In a normal combat situation
the radar would differentiate between the participants with simple
colour coding: green for friendly, red for hostile and white for
unknown. His radar had been functioning as normal when he had
launched, but only a few minutes into the battle every item on the
screen had turned green. In that state it made it impossible to
decipher hostile targets from friendly ones. To make matters worse,
his opponents were flying the same craft as he and his squadron, so
that even at visual range he could not be certain whether he was
about to open fire on friend or foe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Jules!” he said,
opening a communications channel to a life long team mate. He
attempted to keep his voice steady as he spoke, trying his best to
avoid drawing any of his allies into his own personal hell. “Is
your radar any good?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Jacques!” the
familiar female voice came back to him, sounding grateful to hear
from a friend. “Where are you? I'm
flying blind here! I can't
see a thing!” The anxiety and distress was clear in her own voice.
Chalmers had known Jules for years, she was almost like a sister to
him. For him to hear her in such a state horrified him. He longed to
open a video link, to look into her eyes and tell her that everything
was going to be okay, that they would both get through this. But with
his fighter in its current state, he dared not touch anything for
fear it would make matters worse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As he tried to think of
how best to relay his present location to his team mate, he noticed
that the radar had tagged the craft he was speaking to; a thin,
blinking white rectangular box outlining the green triangle. For a
brief moment his anguish subsided and he brought his craft around to
face Jules' fighter. He could see her weaving and twirling in a
similar fashion to his own meandering and confused flight, the
cannons of her fighter as quiet as his own.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Jules, check your
radar. I'm...” Chalmers
began. Jules' starfighter
exploded before him, a pair of fighters peeling away from the
wreckage that spread out like a firework. His small glimmer of hope
melted as soon as it had first appeared and he felt the words he was
about to speak become lodged in his throat. Though he had witnessed
it so many times before, to see two fighters identical to his own
open fire on and destroy an allied craft was still an awful sight to
behold. It was not like combat against foreign craft, those of the
Confederacy or Independent Nations, for instance. This was more
personal, as though one was watching dear friends turn on each other
again and again. For longer than was wise he sat staring at the
sparking, spinning metal that continued to spread out. Chalmers took
it as sign that the destruction he had witnessed over the last few
months was edging ever closer to engulfing him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No...” the pitiful
sound of his own voice finally escaped him. He felt his throat close
up, but forced back the tears he could feel welling up and
threatening to blur his vision. His fighter gave a heavy jolt as he
was hit from behind and he banked hard, seeing a stream of bright
green plasma streak past him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
In the wake of the
attack, he tried to think. He could wheel around and go after the
closest craft to him, hoping that he was opening fire on a hostile.
However, he risked killing a friend who had assumed that <I>he</I>
was the Enemy. A voice from his comms system drew his attention,</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“All available
support, this is <I>Minotaur</I>.
We are sustaining heavy damage. Requesting immediate assistance!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chalmers felt the panic
rising further within him and fought to control it. <I>INF </I><I>Minotaur</I>
was the Imperial flagship; a symbol of the Empire's
glory. Historically, its very presence within a conflict zone was
enough to spur the Imperial combatants on to victory. But a desperate
request for help from the great battleship could only lower morale.
He could not allow such a thing to happen. He pushed recent events
behind him and looked around for the great capital ship. Even though
he could not identify it on the cluttered mess of green that was his
radar, its sheer size meant that he would have no trouble locating it
with his own two eyes. He saw it hanging high above the planet
Kethlan; the former Seat of the Emperor and the planet where he
himself had been born.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He changed his heading,
raising his velocity to maximum and sped forward. Even at this
distance he could make out the explosions ripping across the hull,
blooming before dissipating. <I>Minotaur</I><I>'</I><I>s</I>
laser and plasma cannons were firing indiscriminatingly in all
directions, whilst volleys of return fire impacted further on its
surface, the battleship's
shielding all but destroyed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As he drew closer to
the once proud symbol of Imperial might, he came to realise that he
was looking at the future. The official line from the Empire to their
galactic neighbours was that they were entrenched in a civil war. To
those within the Imperium itself the truth was far more shocking.
Over three quarters of the Imperial armed forces had so far been
defeated, more than a dozen of its star systems having fallen to the
Enemy. Unless they could halt the advances of the Enemy here and now,
it would not be long before the Imperium was lost forever, confined
to the annals of time; and then the rest of the galaxy would follow.
He wondered if the true story had come out, whether the Independent
Worlds or the Confederacy had seen through their spin.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Though it had taken him
longer than he wanted, even at full speed, he was within visual range
of other fighter craft. As he entered the thick of combat, it dawned
on him that he did not need his radar any more; he had only to aim
for any craft that was firing upon <I>Minotaur</I>.
He could see several dozen starfighters attempting to tackle
<I>Minotaur</I><I>'</I><I>s</I>
attackers, their work cut out as they struggled against the far
greater numbers of heavier fighters the Enemy flew. The lightly armed
and shielded Jackals that he and his team mates piloted were almost
all that remained of their complement, the majority of their own
heavy-class fighters having been destroyed in combat months earlier.
Though the Jackal was faster than the other starfighters and able to
out-manoeuvre them, Chalmers was aware that in his current state of
shattered nerves he would need a lot of luck if he wanted to exploit
such capabilities to his advantage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Picking out a target
the Imperial fighter pilot aligned himself with the aggressor and
opened fire. The shots sailed harmlessly past their target, leaving
Chalmers to curse and attempt to calm himself down so that he could
aim straight. His right hand was shaking. He took hold of it in his
other and flexed his fingers. He tried to convince himself it was
still possible that the Imperial forces might all somehow get through
this, that they would secure a victory here today; that they could at
last turn the tide and the nightmare that had started five years ago
would end.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
A steady bleeping from
his on-board computer system dragged him from his dreams of hope. He
recognised the sound as the lock warning and instinctively looked to
his radar for the location and speed of the incoming threat. At the
same time that he remembered his radar was useless to him, an
explosion rocked his fighter, the sound of the missile lock warning
cutting out, to be replaced by another, far more urgent tone. Though
having rarely heard it before, Chalmers knew just what it meant. His
starfighter's speed dropped
off and the craft began to tumble, the engines no longer functional.
Both his computer screens were flashing the word “EJECT”.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chalmers reached up for
the ejection control, his fingers wrapping around the handle. But he
stopped short of pulling it, turning his attention once more to the
scene outside. Bright green bolts of plasma flew in every direction;
thick red, yellow and blue pulsing lines of various beam weapons
sweeping around elsewhere; trails from missiles curling about the
chaos as they hunted down their targets. Fighter craft circled
<I>Minotaur</I>,
continuing to open fire on the stricken battleship and each other.
<I>Minotaur</I><I>'</I><I>s</I>
cannons were silent. He knew it was only a matter of time before it
was completely destroyed.</P>

From the bridge of the
Imperial carrier, <I>INF
Chimera</I>, Fleet Admiral Zackaria watched the last
minutes of <I>Minotaur</I><I>'</I><I>s</I>
service to the Imperium unmoved. The destruction of the enormous
battleship and the tremendous loss of life brought him no sadness nor
regret. He turned to his second in command and spoke to him in a
strange tongue. <I>Minotaur</I>
was lost; it was useless to them. Let it burn. If they could not have
this battleship, then they would just acquire another. One that was
not so fragile; one that reflected the majesty of the Imperium; one
that would help them to complete the Mission.</P>

Commodore Rissard spoke
his understanding of the admiral's
request and moved to comply with it. Their short exchange over,
Zackaria turned back to the scene of the soon to be concluded battle
and continued to watch in silence.</P>

“May... M...day!”
Chalmers' weak comms
crackled as <I>Minotaur</I><I>'</I><I>s</I>
final fleeting requests broadcast out to the overwhelmed Imperial
forces. Though his fighter's
screens were still flashing their suggested course of action,
Chalmers knew there was no point in ejecting; he was dead already.
Escape pods could be seen jettisoning themselves from <I>Minotaur</I>,
their occupants doing nothing but prolonging the inevitable:
prisoners would not be taken, lives would not be spared.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
For him, there was
nowhere further to run. Not that running had ever been an option.
From this Enemy you could not run and you could not hide. With the
acceptance of his death, Chalmers'
panic finally subsided. He would soon be at peace with his friends.
With that he released his grip on the ejection handle and let the
tears trickle down his face.</P>

<B STYLE="font-size:1.16em;">N</B>early
six months had passed since Chalmers'
death, the fall of Kethlan and the destruction of <I>Minotaur</I>;
and on the other side of the known galaxy, Simon Dodds was awoken by
the sound of someone, or something, thumping on the porch door of his
parents'
house. At first, he thought that the three loud thuds had been the
result of the unlocked front door banging in the wind. Glancing out
of his bedroom window, however, he saw the branches of the apple
trees standing peaceful and serene in the moonlight of the cloudless
night. Ignoring the disturbance, he turned over to catch some more
sleep before the inevitable onset of his father's
daily routine of dragging him out of bed to help work the fields, or
deal with the orchards'
tedious administration. Despite the fact that Simon was only staying
with his parents for a short time - if one could count six months as
short - his father was not about to permit him free food and lodgings
without making him pull his weight. Maybe today he could try
disappearing into town and hiding out in a bar for a few hours.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He had just shut his
eyes again when another two thuds came from below, followed by the
unmistakable sound of a man's
distressed voice crying out for attention. It was followed by the
sound of loud, uneven feet clumping down the porch steps and then
scraping up the well-worn dirt track leading away from the house.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Now more or less awake,
Simon took a look at his bedside clock. The illuminated green numbers
informed him that it was just past four thirty; too early for any of
the orchard's hired help to be turning up. With great reluctance he
threw back the covers and pulled himself out of bed, making his way
to the window. His bedroom was located at the front of the house,
more or less above the front door. He shoved the window all the way
open and leaned out to investigate the source of the noise, which had
since ceased. No sooner had he stuck his head out the window when he
spotted a figure sprawled on the ground, halfway up the track. He
leaned further out and took a quick look around the surrounding area.
Seeing no-one aside from the body, he drew back inside, turned around
and gave a start.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Who is it?” his
father asked him. Gregory Dodds, also awoken by the commotion, had
wandered into his son's
bedroom. Simon noticed that he clutched a shotgun in one hand, no
doubt in preparation for whomever he believed was attempting to break
into their property; it wouldn't have been the first time. His father
had already activated the weapon, a digital counter towards the rear
of the gun gently illuminating the man's
chest with a soft blue light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“There's
someone outside,” Simon said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Where?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Halfway up the
track, face down in the dirt.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Simon's
father shoved past to see for himself and, just as Simon had done,
took a quick glance around to see if there was anyone else about.
Satisfied that the figure was the only probable source of the
disturbance that had woken the family, he turned once more to his
son.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We'll
go and have a look. I'll
have your mother get ready to call the police.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Simon nodded in
agreement. “Here,” he said, reaching out to take the shotgun from
his father.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
His father pulled back,
pushing Simon's hand away from the weapon and giving him a
distrustful look. “You've got to be joking!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm not going to
shoot you in the back, Dad,” Simon said. “You've got to start
trusting me again.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Just put some
clothes on,” Gregory answered, leaving Simon's room.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Simon pulled on the
previous day's clothes, that he picked up off a chair, and laced up
some boots before joining his father on the upstairs landing. By all
appearances his father had made a similar decision with his attire
and the pair made their way down the stairs and opened the front
door.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">

<P CLASS="western">
The figure in the dirt
remained motionless. Leaving his father to guard the front door,
Simon hurried up the track and knelt down next to the body.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hey,” he said,
giving the man a gentle shake about the shoulder. The man let out a
groan and Simon wondered if he was a drunkard who had staggered up to
the house, searching for a place to sleep. He then discovered that
the unpleasant, sticky wetness he felt on his hand was not vomit or
alcohol; it was blood.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“He's
hurt!” Simon called to his father, looking at the blood and dirt
that clung to his fingers. His father quickened his step, joining his
son by the body. Simon became aware of the man's
attire and realised that he was wearing a somewhat loose fitting
Confederation Stellar Navy flight suit. He rolled the man over onto
his back carefully, discovering the front of the suit to be torn and
bloody.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“One of your bloody
lot,” his father muttered, kneeling down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Looks like he's
been shot,” Simon said. Even though it was still before sunrise, he
was able to make out the dark patches of blood glistening on the
suit. The wounded man's eyes
fluttered open and his gaze fell upon the two that knelt over him. He
tried to speak, but the effort seemed too great, only a whisper
escaping his lips.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hey, you okay?”
Simon asked, speaking in a loud and clear voice. The man gave him no
response, his eyes starting to close again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Can you stand?”
Gregory asked, but there was no reply. “Let's
get him inside the house,” he suggested. Simon watched as he
trotted back up the worn track to relieve himself of the shotgun,
before returning to his side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Ready?” Gregory
asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Ready.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Simon lifted the man
under the arms, his father taking his legs, the pair ignoring the
groans from their unexpected guest. They made it back to the house,
Simon noticing for the first time the dark red bloodstains on the
outside of the door where the man had thumped on the white painted
wood.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Oh God!” Simon's
mother breathed as they struggled through the door and carried the
man into the living room. She had pulled on a thin dressing gown over
her night dress. She was a tall woman, with blonde hair and, at this
moment, a shocked expression. A cat, that had been enjoying a
blissful doze on a chair, lifted its head and then shrank back as it
saw the stranger in the men's
arms. It jumped down from its resting place and darted out the room,
past the three men, the bell on its collar tinkling as it went.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sally, shotgun's
just inside the porch, could you fetch it inside?” Gregory said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“He's
been shot,” Simon added as he and his father deposited the heavily
breathing man onto the couch. Sally did as Gregory requested,
bringing the shotgun inside and propping it up against a wall in the
hallway, the ammunition counter projecting a blue hue onto a small
spot on the wooden floor where it was placed. Sally moaned as she saw
where the two men had set the man who had woken them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Greg, you're
going to get blood all over the couch,” she said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Well, we can't
exactly just dump him on the ground,” Gregory said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Simon noted a couple of
splotches of blood on the wooden floor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We need to get him
comfortable.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Who is he? Where did
he come from?” Sally said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“He's
CSN, Mum,” Simon said. “Do you know where the first-aid kit is?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hello? Can you hear
me? What's your name?”
Gregory was still trying to get a response.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It's
“Dean”, Dad, it says so on his suit,” Simon said, pointing out
the lettering on the left breast beneath the squadron logo. “Mum,
first-aid? He's bleeding
pretty badly,” Simon prompted his mother who was staring at the
injured man.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'll
call an ambulance,” Sally said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“And you can call one
of your friends at the Navy straight after,” Gregory added to
Simon. “There's got to be a number for this sort of thing, right?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“N... No! Don't!”
the stranger named Dean cried out, looking around for who was
speaking. The three jumped at his voice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You need medical
treatment. We have to get you to a hospital or a doctor,” Sally
said, looking about the living room. “Where's the handset?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“The handset?”
Gregory said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“For the phone.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I don't know. It's
probably fallen down the back of the couch again. Just use the video
screen in the hall.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No... no doctors! No
Navy!” Dean protested, finding the strength to talk. “Let... let
me stay... here! Please!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hey, calm down,”
Simon said. “You're in
shock.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dean looked quite
distressed as Sally left the living room and walked out of his view,
his breathing becoming erratic.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Where's
the first-aid?” Simon asked his father.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Your mother knows,”
Gregory answered. “We'll
get it after she's called
the ambulance.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Simon,” the young
man heard his mother call from out in the hall. He left his father
with Dean and found his mother floundering in front of the video
phone that hung on the wall. “I can't remember how we do this.
That's why I wanted to use the handset instead of this stupid thing.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Just tap the screen
anywhere and then press the “Emergency Services” icon,” Simon
prompted. He positioned himself within the doorway of the living
room, so that he could both keep an eye on their guest and jump in to
assist his mother should she need it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Sally tapped the
touch-sensitive screen to bring the phone out of its sleep state, the
device lighting up and displaying icons and options. She stabbed at
the “Emergency Services”
icon and hugged at herself as the screen informed her the video phone
was connecting. Before long, it did so. From his skewed angle of the
screen, Simon could just make out the headset wearing blonde woman
who answered the call.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What service do you
require?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Ambulance,” Sally
said, then hastened to add, “we've
got a man here suffering from gunshot wounds.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What's
his condition?” The woman's fingers tapped away at an unseen
device.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“He's
bleeding quite heavily. Not sure how many times he was shot, but he
can't walk and can barely
speak. We had to carry him into the living room from outside the
house.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Are the wounds the
result of a projectile or energy weapon?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I... er... I
don't...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Are there any burn
marks? If it was an energy weapon then in most cases you'd
be able to smell the burnt clothes and wounds.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Sally glanced over to
Simon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Bullets, Mum,” he
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Bullets,” Sally
repeated.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Okay, thank you,”
the operator confirmed, maintaining her calm. Simon could see his
mother ringing at her dressing grown quite hard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Has he been shot in
the arms, legs, torso, or head?” the woman wanted to know.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“His body. The chest,
it looks like.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The woman at the
emergency services tapped away and then paused, looking down at
something for a few moments, a curious expression on her face. “Could
you hold the line for a minute, please? Thank you.” Her image
disappeared, to be replaced with the medical services logo.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Simon, she's just
hung up,” Sally said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Are you sure?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It's gone back to
this,” Sally indicated the logo occupying the display. Simon was
about to start over to investigate, when the operator who had
answered the call re-appeared on the screen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Could you confirm
your name and address?” she requested. Sally did. “Okay, good.
Someone will be with you within the next thirty or forty minutes. Now
listen carefully: please don't move the victim since you could cause
him additional trauma. The bullets may have missed vital organs, so
we don't want to do anything
that could result in further injury. The biggest risk to their life
will come from loss of blood. If you are able, dress the wounds and
try to stem any blood loss. It could make the difference between life
and death. Don't move him from the house or attempt to bring him to
us yourself.” The operator hung up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Sally swore and came
back into the living room.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What's wrong?”
Gregory asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“They're
not going to be here for another thirty minutes, at least.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Thirty minutes?”
Gregory said, horrified.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>At
least</I>!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We'll
have to take him ourselves,” Simon said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, they said not to
move him, it could make things worse,” Sally said, wringing her
hands. “We're going to
have to do the best we can for him until they get here. I'll
find a first-aid kit. Simon can you call the Navy?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, he said not to,”
Simon said, shaking his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
His mother stared at
him in disbelief for a second. “Simon...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, I can't. He
asked us not to contact them. Didn't
you hear him?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Simon, don't talk to
your mother that way,” Gregory said, a scowl on his face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm
just following protocol, Dad,” Simon answered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Gregory glared at his
son. “Oh, so <I>now</I>
you decide that it's time to
start doing as you're
told...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I always do as I'm
told.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You could've fooled
me...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Oh for God's
sake, stop it you two, just stop it!” Sally said. “Don't start
having <I>that</I>
conversation again, especially now. I've heard it every day for the
last five months.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm just trying to
do the right thing,” Simon said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“And why couldn't you
have done the right thing <I>then</I>?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It was an <I>accident</I>,
Mum. Those people were just there. It's not as if I decided to shoot
them all on purpose. I didn't go out of my way to take their lives.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“And now you're just
going to let it happen here instead,” Sally said, choking back
tears and pushing past Simon, leaving the living room and the three
men behind her. Simon watched as she walked in the direction of the
kitchen and began pulling things out of cupboards in a search for
sufficient medical supplies. He began to start after his distressed
mother.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Simon, wait there a
moment,” his father called. Simon turned back to the scene in the
living room, watching his father undoing Dean's
flight suit and trying to get a better look at his injuries. The
extent of the damage was clear even before the white vest Dean wore
beneath the suit was pulled up. Two dark holes were prominent in
Dean's chest, blood still
seeping out with each breath. Gregory stood and walked over to Simon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Why doesn't
this guy want us to call an ambulance or the Navy?” Gregory asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Simon shrugged. “It's
possible that he's involved in some kind of covert operation.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Covert?” His
father screwed up his face. “You mean he's
meant to be doing something in secret?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah. Or with very
little exposure. Whatever it is, he doesn't want certain people
within the Navy finding out about it.” Simon looked at Dean, who
was still taking heavy gasps of air.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Well what does he
expect <I>us</I> to do
with him?” Gregory asked in somewhat accusing tones. Gregory
studied the man for a moment. “Do you know him?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No,” Simon shook
his head. “I've never seen
him before in my life. Honest,” he added, seeing the unconvinced
look his father gave him. They returned to Dean and knelt down next
to the couch.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Looks like he's
been shot in the chest and shoulders. You stay here with him. I'll
help your mother find some bandages and something to plug up the
wounds.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dean was staring up at
the ceiling and breathing hard, struggling to catch his breath. Simon
decided to try and discover what had happened whilst he still could.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Don't
worry, mate, everything's
going to be okay. You'll
just have a few scars to show your friends.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dean said nothing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Confederation
Stellar Navy, eh? I'm in the
service myself, although it's
a little complicated right now.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>Just
in case you</I><I>'</I><I>re
wondering why a twenty-nine-year-old is still living at home with his
mum and dad</I>, Simon thought to himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dean still said
nothing, his eyes remaining fixed on the ceiling.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>Yellow
Dogs</I>?” Simon noted the emblem of a cartoon dog,
tongue lolling from its mouth, on the outside of Dean's
flight suit. “Not heard of you guys. I usually fly with the <I>White
Knights</I>.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
At Simon's
words, Dean turned his head to look at the young man, his eyes filled
with anguish.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“A... TAF... ject...”
he tried, the effort of speaking appearing quite great.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What?” Simon drew
closer. “Say that again.” Simon could hear his mother's
distressed voice carrying through from the kitchen as she spoke to
his father, evidently quite upset by what she had been dragged into.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“... you don't
know who's done this to him.
They could come around here looking for him,” she was saying.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We didn't
see anyone else outside,” Gregory said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“But how did he get
here? Did he drive? Where's
his car?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“He's
a pilot. Maybe he parachuted?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“So where was his
parachute? Where did his plane or whatever it was come down?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I don't
know, Sal.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We don't even know
if he is who he says he is. For all we know, he could be one of those
terrorists from Mitikas. You know how it starts - they come over here
one by one and then start blowing each other up.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
There was a clatter and
then a heavy crash, followed by cursing from his mother.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That man is going to
die unless he gets to a hospital.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Simon forced himself to
filter out the rest. He was intent on discovering what had happened
to Dean and how he had come to be there. The wounded pilot reached
out and placed a limp hand on his shoulder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“A... T.. AF...
operation...” the man tried again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You ejected from
your TAF?” Simon asked, trying to make sense of what Dean was
saying. If he'd ejected from his TAF how did he get all those bullet
wounds? Had someone managed to shoot him while he sat in the cockpit?
That didn't make any sense.
Bullets would have a hard time getting through the toughened canopy,
let alone the energy shields surrounding the fighter. “Where did
you come down?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The man started
coughing and took another deep breath. “Imperial war... wrong...”
was all he could manage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Simon didn't know what
he was talking about. The Imperial civil war was wrong? Of course it
was, lots of people had lost their lives in that unending conflict.
Dean was making very little sense.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Right, Simon, give
me a hand here.” Gregory reappeared in the living room, carrying a
small red first-aid box and a much larger medical kit. He dumped them
both on the floor at the foot of the couch and together the pair did
their best to bandage the man, but they both knew that he would die
without proper medical attention.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As Simon bandaged the
bullet wounds in the man's
chest, in a futile attempt to stem the flow of blood, he noticed his
mother in the doorway. She was still distressed and he could make out
the tears sliding down her face. He was well aware of what she must
have been thinking: one day it might be her son in the same position,
being patched up by friends, or strangers, as they did their best to
prolong his life for what might well prove to be only a few minutes.
He smiled back at her, to let her know it would be okay. Following
naval protocol or not, he now regretted the way he had spoken to her.
Dean could not have been much older than himself, something which had
likely compounded her anguish.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The wounded pilot never
took his eyes off Simon as he and his father tried to make him
comfortable and stable.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>Sudarberg</I>,”
Dean said all of a sudden, still staring at Simon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What did he say?”
Gregory asked, the two men ceasing their messy bandaging to listen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>Sudarberg</I>?”
Simon asked, leaning closer to Dean.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Y... yes. Stay...
a.. aw.. way.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Where's
<I>Sudarberg</I>?”
Gregory asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I don't
know, I've never heard of
it. Where's <I>Sudarberg</I>?
Why should I stay away from it?” Dean didn't answer, but panted,
struggling to swallow.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“This guy is going to
die unless we can get him to a hospital soon,” his father remarked.
Simon
looked over their attempts to preserve the man's
life, their efforts far poorer than what he had originally
envisioned. Whilst the medical kits contained a number of dressings,
bandages and solutions designed to stimulate rapid coagulation, they
were not enough to contend with Dean's
kinds of injuries, nor his sustained blood loss. They persevered for
a while longer until Gregory threw in the towel.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Right, Simon, call
your friends at the Navy,” Gregory said. “We've been at this for
ages now and that ambulance could still take quite a while to get
here. The Navy might be able to get here quicker. Whatever this guy
is worried about, I'm sure
its not worth dying over.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Simon conceded to what
his father was saying and, pushing protocol aside, he made the call.
He then sat with Dean, attempting to get a little more information
out of him whilst they waited for help to arrive. But Dean was done
talking and less than twenty minutes later he was dead.</P>

“Where exactly did
you find him?” a representative of the Naval Investigation Services
was asking the Dodds family. It was quite late in the morning and
several men and women were carrying out final investigations of the
perimeter of the family home. The ambulance that had been called had
never arrived. Instead, a military medical transport had showed up, a
number of heavily armed personnel accompanying the medical team into
the house. In addition, a large area around the house and orchards
had been sealed off, the workers arriving at the orchard being turned
away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“He was lying there,
face down on the ground,” Gregory said, pointing at the spot where
they had found Dean. “How much longer is this going to take? You've
been here for bloody hours. I've
got pickers and harvesters waiting to get to work.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I just need to
ensure I have all the details down, Mr Dodds,” the rep said,
tapping away at a hand held device with a stylus. “After you found
him, what did you do next?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“For the love of God,
are you deaf?” Simon's
father glowered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Dad, don't
worry, I'll deal with this,”
Simon said, seeing his father's last thread of patience about to
snap. “Go and check that they're
not destroying the house.” His mother and father departed and Simon
turned back to the representative. “We brought him inside and
called for an ambulance. The medical services told us it would be
over half an hour before they could get to us, so we attempted to
patch him up ourselves.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The man nodded.
“According to your call records, you waited a good twenty-five
minutes before placing the call to the nearest military hospital,
regarding Lieutenant Commander Dean's
condition. Why did you wait so long?” He kept the device in his
hand held up. Simon suspected it was recording everything that was
being said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I considered that he
may have been taking part in a classified mission and I needed to be
sure I wouldn't be putting
the operation or other participants at risk by drawing attention to
his presence.” Simon stopped short of telling him about Dean's
objection to the call for an ambulance or other medical assistance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The rep, however,
seemed satisfied. “Okay, that's
fine. I can appreciate that it was a difficult position you found
yourself in, but you made the right decision. I believe you're
currently in the service of the Confederation Stellar Navy yourself?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That's right.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Could you please
state your full name and rank?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Second Lieutenant
Simon Dodds,” Simon said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The man tapped away at
the digital assistant in his hand and waited for it to retrieve the
information he was after. “Hmmmm. Says here that you've been a
pilot for several years and that you are currently on suspension from
active service; reinstatement not due for at least another six to
seven weeks, pending the outcome of further hearings.” He tapped at
the device and then whistled. “Court-martialed back at the
beginning of December on two counts of involuntary manslaughter, as
well as disobeying orders during...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah, yeah, we get
the picture,” Simon interrupted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“So, that's all
correct?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes,” Simon said,
trying not to glare.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“May I ask where
you've been and what you've been doing for the last four and a half
months?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I've
been working here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Doing what,
exactly?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Simon looked around,
then back at the man in disdain. “What the hell do you think? I've
been picking apples!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Cool it,
Lieutenant.” More tapping. “You've
not been anywhere else? Not left the country or the planet?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Fine,” the
representative said. “Did Dean speak much before his death?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Only to tell me that
he had ejected from his Tactical Assault Fighter, though I never
heard it come down. It's
pretty quiet around here, so I'm
sure it would have woken me up. He didn't
manage to tell me how he got all those bullet wounds either.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“The TAF has been
taken care of,” the man stated, eyes focused on the digital
assistant.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Where did it come
down?” Simon asked, looking around a little confused. He half
expected to see a plume of smoke rising from somewhere in the
distance. “Not in one of the orchards?” If the TAF had come down,
then wouldn't there be some sign of its crash? And come to think of
it, where <I>was</I>
Dean's parachute?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, don't worry.
There's no need to be concerned about that. Like I said, it's
been taken care of.” The man raised his eyes from his PDA. “You're
sure he didn't say anything else?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Simon felt as though
the man was trying to suggest that he might be trying to hide
something. “No.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Okay. Thank you for
your co-operation, Lieutenant. You can let your family know that we
will be departing shortly,” the man said before powering down the
PDA and slipping it back into his jacket. He pressed a button on a
device in his ear and spoke to confirm he was finished.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Simon started off to
re-join his mother and father, who were hovering by the porch and
trying to see inside the house.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Excuse me,
Lieutenant,” the NIS representative called out to him, before
jogging over to join the three. “Just one thing before we go...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The three listened as
he made one last point clear: no-one had come to the house that night
and none of them had ever heard of a man by the name of Patrick Dean.
Once they understood and agreed with what he was telling them, he
then informed them, in rather pleasant tones, that they would have
their couch replaced later that day, or early the next. Their living
room had also been thoroughly cleaned, leaving no trace of the
incident.</P>

“Bloody pain in the
arse,” Gregory grumbled as he and Simon tried to locate and
organise any orchard workers who may have decided to return to work
that afternoon, following the Navy's departure. Simon did not
comment, the whole experience seeming a little surreal to him at this
point. “Let's hope that
it'll be another ten years
before we see that lot again.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">

<P CLASS="western">
<B STYLE="font-size:1.16em;">A</B>lthough
the CSN's
reappearance at the Dodds household was by no means discreet, the
first Simon knew about it was due to the sound of his father cursing
at the top of his voice and striding with great displeasure towards
the Confederation transport craft that had landed close to the house.
It had touched down in one of the orchards belonging to the family,
damaging the valuable crop and sending his father into a rage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Simon had been sitting
in the study at the time, pushing a pen around various pieces of
paper. At the sound of his father's
cursing he left the house, seeing the CSN representative that was
making his way up the track; the man removing a white envelope from
within his jacket. Simon's
father strode past him, caring little for what he had to say and only
about what was happening to his field.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Second Lieutenant
Simon Dodds?” the man in full naval dress and sporting a pair of
dark glasses asked, as Simon hurried after his father.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah?” Simon
answered, both men now following Gregory down the track in the
direction of the transport.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“This request came in
from CSN HQ for you today. I should advise you that it is urgent.”
Simon took the envelope from the man and removed the single piece of
folded paper within. Though the letter was brief, the message was
clear: it called for his immediate return to duty. His suspension was
over, even though he had only served five months of the six he had
been handed. Odd. Suspensions often ran far longer, whilst the
Confederation Stellar Navy considered reinstatement of personnel.
Stranger still was that the request had been made in the form of a
personal letter. A video call was far more usual. The Navy's
presence at the family home, to hand deliver said letter, further
compounded the supposed urgent nature of the request.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Do I have to leave
right now?” Simon asked, lowering the letter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No,” the man shook
his head. “But I'd suggest you be prepared to do so early tomorrow
morning.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Was the request made
on behalf of anyone in particular?” Simon said, turning the piece
of paper over a few times.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I believe it was
Commodore Parks,” the delegate said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Simon looked again at
the letter, trying to extract some more information; trying to read
what was not there. As he did so, he vaguely heard the messenger
telling his father that the family business would be compensated for
any untoward damage to his field.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“A CSN inspector and
maybe even a government inspector, if need be, will be dispatched to
assess the possible damage.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, that's
not good enough,” his father bellowed back at the dark glasses
wearing man, who raised both hands in a defensive gesture. “That's
an <I>organic
field</I>! We don't
use chemicals, <I>or</I>
machinery to pick the produce. We do <I>everything</I>
by hand! And you have gone and contaminated the entire region with
your blatant disregard for the honest working man...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Workers handling
various pieces of farming equipment and clutching baskets brimming
with apples were looking from their employer to the naval delegate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“As I said sir, I am
sorry for any damage that we may have caused...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“And yet you are
still not shutting off those damn engines!” Gregory said in
disbelief, throwing his hands up in the air. The shuttle's
engines were burning the grass behind it and Simon could only guess
at the long-term effects it might have on the crop.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The Dodds family owned
several orchards and were proud to be one of the few remaining large
scale organic farms remaining in Ireland. Much of the produce was
sold to be used in premium organic juices. Others worked their way
into stores throughout western Europe. Though rather impressive,
Simon had had enough of apples for the time being.</P>

He spent much of the
afternoon stuffing clothes into a bag in preparation for his
departure early the next morning. His father's voice had drifted up
the stairs to his room as he did so; the man expectant of not only a
very large cheque from the CSN, but an even bigger apology.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Gregory was still
seething over the CSN's
visit to his orchard when Simon joined his parents at the table for
dinner. The true extent of the damage had become clear once they had
departed and it wasn't good. He shot Simon a dark look as he settled
into his chair, the young man quite aware that his father was holding
him partly responsible for the events of the past couple of weeks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You know they only
want you to come back and sign something so they can get shot of
you,” Gregory muttered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I doubt that,”
Simon said, taking a sip of orange juice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
His father tutted.
“Well, even if they don't you should give it up anyway; get
yourself a proper job.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You don't
have to go, you know. You could just stay here,” his mother
commented as she deposited three plates of chicken, rice and salad on
the table.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Your mother's
right,” his father muttered again, not giving Simon a chance to
speak. “You should have just worked here instead of joining the
Navy. You wouldn't have to
worry about promotions, gruelling exercises, crap food or even
chances of getting killed. You could be giving out the orders instead
of receiving them. Other people would be doing the work. I've been
there, Simon. It's not worth it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Simon paused in the
process of cutting into his chicken and set his knife and fork back
down on the table. This again. “Dad, you were never in the Navy,”
he said, rolling his eyes. It was the same thing his father had said
to him the day he had told them of his plan to become a pilot in the
CSN. He sometimes wished he had a brother or sister, if only to have
someone on which to deflect unwanted attention.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
His father waved his
glass of red wine dismissively, but said nothing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“And the request is
urgent,” Simon reminded him, not touching his food until he could
gain some sort of support for his decision.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You'll
be back here in a few days,” his father said, sipping the wine and
reaching for a small granary roll.</P>

In truth, his father
was not being negative about Simon's ability, or intentions to
continue his career within the Navy; he had just become used to
having Simon around for the last few months. Simon had been in the
Navy for close to ten years and his mother and father had missed
seeing him grow into an adult.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Or at least that's
what his mother had told him as she stood at his bedroom door that
night, after his father had turned in. At that time a small part of
Simon did not want to leave, having become comfortable back at the
orchard, with his family close by. But a bigger part of him was set
in the decision to return. Even his father's
attempt at emotional blackmail could not dissuade him from responding
to the CSN's request. Though
he could just as well have refused it and then terminated his
service, he did not. He owed it to himself to put things right.</P>

Simon made his goodbyes
and left first thing the next morning, the transport waiting for him
further down the road this time. He had been summoned not to another
planet in Sol, but to another star system within the Confederacy
known as Indigo.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The interior of the
transport was like that of a small private jet, if not quite as
luxurious. A small screen, fixed to the left of his seat, displayed
their planned route, overlaid across the galactic map he had seen so
many time before. A great number of inhabited and uninhabited star
systems were dotted all over the chart: the Confederacy, home of
Earth, lay on the right-hand side, its systems grouped quite closely
together; though there were a few stragglers here and there; the
Mitikas Empire, on the left, comprised of a far greater number of
systems, all snuggled together like fish that had been dragged up in
a net; and then there were the Independent Worlds, running between
the two huge nations like a gulf or a river, keeping them apart and
acting like a buffer of sorts. Here and there throughout the declared
independent space, star systems were marked as belonging to the
Empire from where it had spidered out and captured some during the
latter days of its expansion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
His eyes lingered on a
few of the systems that were labelled in a larger type than others:
Sol and Alpha Centauri within the Confederacy; Alba, one of the more
powerful and prosperous of the Independents; Krasst and Kethlan of
the Empire, their lettering and stars rendered in red hues. For some
reason, the colour looked a little ominous compared with the whites
and blues. He turned his mind to other things.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With the knowledge that
the system he was travelling to was several hundred light years from
Earth, Simon was confident that his reinstatement was assured. It was
a long way to bring someone only to tell them that their service
within the Navy was no longer required. And surely the only reason
they were bringing him all the way out there was because they needed
him back as soon as possible?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
But during the trip,
Simon had found himself still arguing against his father's
alternate explanation for his summons back to duty: what if he really
was going to be discharged? Even though at the end of his hearing
five months ago he had been handed a suspension due to “lack of
evidence” - the testimonies of four eye witnesses, for some reason,
did not count - he was still not one hundred percent sure. It was
possible that the committee and top brass needed him to come all the
way out there, so they could discharge him in the correct manner,
being too busy to travel themselves.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Simon had looked out at
the stars whilst his transport craft had awaited clearance to jump
from Sol to Indigo and thought back upon the events that had led him
to where he was now.</P>

It was whilst flying
with his own wing, the <I>White
Knights</I>,
and under the command of Commodore Hawke, a man whom he had failed to
see eye to eye with ever since the first time the two had met, that
Simon had disobeyed a direct order, with disastrous consequences.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
On a tiny Confederation
planet, little larger than Sol's own Pluto, a large separatist
faction from an Independent World state had secreted themselves.
Despite knowing the planet to be home to many planetary explorers and
independent research groups, the Confederation had allowed them to do
so, intending to strike and bring to an end their repeated acts of
aggression once they were all together. When the time had come, the
Confederation's armed forces
had launched a large scale operation with the intention of
simultaneously evacuating the explorers and eliminating the enemy. As
night had fallen, landers had touched down and ground troops and
vehicles had streamed out. Large drop ships broke the atmosphere and
deployed fighter craft, Simon and the <I>White
Knights</I> amongst them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Though it had started
well, the operation ran into difficulty when reinforcement enemy
fighters had arrived in the conflict zone without warning. Following
their appearance, Hawke had ordered the air support to pull back. He
was concerned that the additional aerial combat would have a
detrimental effect on the success of the mission, endangering the
ground teams as the risk of friendly fire to and from the surface
increased.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As the squadrons pulled
back, Simon had witnessed two of his wingmates being brought down
and, frustrated with the way things were going, had looped back
around to try and prevent further losses. His efforts had resulted in
his own fighter sustaining heavy damage and dropping from the sky. He
had ditched not far from a rescue point. In the confusion - and with
the desire to get back from the advancing enemy lines as quickly as
possible - Simon had retrieved a weapon from a downed soldier and
headed back towards the extraction zone.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Along the way, he had
been surprised by a group of men and women who had run into him. His
own survival instinct had kicked in, causing him to open fire. It was
only after blood had splattered the ground, soaking into the dark
sand, colouring small rocks and pebbles, and covering the bodies of
his victims and the hands of those that were trying to help them that
he realised who he was shooting at.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
For the unlawful
killings of Poppy Castro and Stefan Pitt, the blatant disregard for
orders, and the loss of a Tactical Assault Fighter he could have
flown home, the court-martial had suspended him from duty for six
months. He had returned to Earth, tail between his legs, to stay out
the time with his parents and get away from everything.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The whole experience
was one that he never wished to go through again.</P>

After several hours,
his transport arrived in the Indigo system and not long there after
docked at Xalan Orbital Station where he was to meet with the senior
command.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>Time
to be known as Dodds again</I>, Simon thought as he
picked up his belongings. An attendant met him as he exited the
transport and led him from the landing deck to a lift and, from
there, down the various corridors to his appointment. The escort
rushed him along, giving Dodds no time, or place, to stow his bag.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Second Lieutenant
Simon Dodds to see the Admiral,” Dodds'
escort informed one of the two female security guards standing
outside the meeting room. She communicated the message to another
standing within. The door was opened.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Fleet Admiral Turner
is waiting for you inside,” the woman said, gesturing for him to go
forward.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Admiral Turner?”
Dodds repeated, feeling his mouth go dry.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir. Fleet
Admiral Turner.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>They
didn</I><I>'</I><I>t
bother to put </I>that<I>
into the letter</I>, Dodds thought, before realising
his jaw had become slack and that his mouth was hanging open. He shut
it and cleared his throat. “Thank you,” he said and entered the
meeting room.</P>

<P CLASS="western">
Walking up to the
front, he set his bag down, removed his cap, and saluted the three
men seated behind a long, well polished wooden table.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Second Lieutenant
Simon Dodds reporting as requested, sir,” Dodds presented himself.
He stood before the three men in full naval dress: a pair of dark
blue trousers and blazer with gold trims and buttons. On his feet he
wore a pair of well-polished black shoes, which he had become quite
conscious of in the last couple of minutes, for some reason. Perhaps
it was because of the clamorous clopping they made as he walked,
announcing his arrival much more than he would have liked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
There was no answer
from any of the men behind the table. The admiral, seated in the
middle, continued his unhurried leaf through a number of pieces of
paper in front of him, apparently deciding to make him wait on
purpose.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds recognised all
three of the men in front of him: Commodore Parks and Commodore Hawke
sat either side of Turner, both waiting patiently for the admiral to
begin. Behind the desk, a window that made up the entire back wall
permitted Dodds a view of the twinkling stars outside. He forced
himself not to be distracted by the sight. Aside from the four men,
only two others occupied the room: both armed security personnel by
the closed door at the other end, rifles drawn and pointed down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He waited some more.
Turner continued to turn pages. Dodds started to get the impression
that what was about to be discussed was quite confidential. After
sometime, Turner looked up from his reading, gathering together the
papers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Before we begin,
Lieutenant Dodds, I have a question I want to ask you.” The admiral
clasped his hands together on the desk before him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir,” Dodds
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Tell me: what does
the name “Lieutenant Commander Patrick Dean” mean to you?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“He's
a TAF pilot, sir. Flies with the <I>Yellow
Dogs</I>. He was recently injured in the line of duty,”
Dodds said truthfully.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Wrong answer,
Dodds,” Turner said with false patience. “I'll
ask you that again. Who is Lieutenant Commander Patrick Dean?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds noticed that all
three of the men were staring fixated at him and he became thankful
for the cap that he held by his side, his grip tightening on it. He
grasped the direction that the admiral's
question was leading him and, remembering what he had been told on
the morning of Dean's death,
supplied his next answer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I don't
know, sir. I've never heard
of him.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Excellent. Neither
have I,” Turner said, sitting back up straight. The man appeared
satisfied with the point he was making, it now very clear in Dodds'
mind. “Shall we get this underway then?” the admiral asked of the
two other officers before turning back to Dodds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“There are three
reasons why you have been brought out here today, Lieutenant,”
began Turner. “None of which should be allowed to go to your head.
First and foremost: it is after considerable discussion that we have
decided that your suspension from duty has been met. You should have
had sufficient time during this period to reflect upon your actions
and realise just how serious and costly your mistakes were.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir,” Dodds
said, straightening. “During my suspension I spent a lot of
time...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Secondly,” Turner
continued, raising his voice whilst at the same time telling Dodds to
silence his own, “naval human resources are at an all time low and
we need every man and woman we can get a hold of. You may be aware of
the on-going problems we are facing securing Confederation interests
against increasing insurgency, as well as the not-so-insubstantial
threat posed by the Imperial civil war. The war is now causing unrest
in a number of Independent World star systems; unrest and disturbance
that could eventually spill over into Confederation-controlled space.
Should that happen, we can be assured that immigrants will come
pouring into many of our own systems, bringing refugees, criminals,
bounty hunters and even more insurgents along with them. In order to
pre-empt such an event we need to increase naval presence along our
borders.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds saw the map he
had studied for the last few hours once more in his head, focusing in
on the former Independent worlds that had been swallowed up by the
Empire. He could not quite imagine the same thing happening in
reverse to the Confederacy, as Turner might well be suggesting. He
might not know a great deal about the history of the galaxy, but he
assumed that the Confederation was a little more stable than most
other places; considerably more so than some of the Independents.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The image evaporated as
Turner continued speaking. “This is a point that needs to be
understood by all Naval personnel: the relationship between the
Imperial Senate and the Emperor is now strained beyond repair and as
such the Confederacy, as well as a number of Independent nations,
have begun the recall of all diplomatic staff. You may hear talk of
parts of the Empire having been <I>bombed
back into the stone age</I>, but for now the Confederation
will <I>not</I> be sending
forces into any part of the region in an attempt to bring about
stability.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds had heard about
the issues that were plaguing the Empire, the events now a regular
feature on news broadcasts. The trouble was that, since it had become
such a regular feature of the news, he had almost stopped paying
attention to it altogether. It was like background noise to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
His
eyes swept over Parks and Hawke sitting either side of Turner. Each
both looked straight at him, as Turner did, their faces inexpressive.
They were both in their forties and of similar height, although Parks
looked thinner than Hawke, both in the body and face. Strands of
silvery grey hair were quite prominent throughout Parks'
thinning black hair, but absent from Hawke's.
Turner by contrast was quite an old man. Dodds thought he was
somewhere in his early sixties, close to retirement age.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds had noticed when
he entered the room that Parks seemed to have aged a good ten years
since he had last seen the man, looking older than Hawke, despite
being six or seven years younger. Strangely, Hawke appeared much
healthier by comparison. Fresh-faced, the man was almost glowing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“And finally
Lieutenant it is my privilege to inform you -”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds detected a hint
of sarcasm in the admiral's
voice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“- that you have been
recommended and subsequently selected for participation in the Navy's
latest technological endeavour. It is not a decision that I entirely
agree with -”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks turned his head
only a minute amount to acknowledge the accusing look he was given by
Admiral Turner.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“- but your flight
profile, along with your <I>usual</I>
ability to work well within a team, made you fit the bill.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Thank you, sir,”
Dodds said. “It will be an honour to take part.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Turner gave an
unconvinced snort, then said, “Tell me, Lieutenant, has anyone
discussed with you anything about the ATAF project?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, sir. No-one has
ever mentioned it to me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“As it should be,”
Turner said. “The project is strictly on a need-to-know basis and,
as of this moment, you are not to discuss it with anyone not directly
involved in the evaluations. I must warn you that to do so would
result in a punishment far worse than a mere suspension from service.
Am I making myself clear?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Good. I believe that
is all I wish to say,” Turner concluded, sliding the papers in
front of him back into their folder. “I did not intend for this to
be a long meeting, so I will wrap things up here. Unless there is
anything further that you wish to add, Commodore?” He looked to
Parks who shook his head. “Commodore?” His attention turned to
Hawke.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I must once again
reiterate my objection to this man's
reinstatement into active service, Admiral!” Hawke spat. “The man
is a cocky, arrogant insubordinate who is a danger to himself, his
squadron and the Navy's very
reputation.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds gave an inward
sigh. It felt as though the commodore had spent several hours before
the meeting rehearsing the line, so as to deliver it without error
for maximum effect. The moment Dodds had entered the meeting room and
seen Hawke seated alongside Turner and Parks, he knew there would be
problems.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I do not doubt for
even one second that he will continue to mock the chain of command
within weeks of being back in control of a starfighter,” Hawke went
on, glaring at Dodds. “It would be better for all of us if the man
were reassigned to logistics where he...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, that will do,
Commodore, I am fully aware of your objections,” interrupted the
admiral, waving him down. “Thank you for repeating your original
statement, but I read it clearly the first time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Hawke turned back to
look at Dodds, a dark scowl across his face. “No, I have nothing
further to add, Admiral,” he finished dryly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds felt a small
sense of relief swell within him. How Hawke loved to gloat. Should
Turner have agreed with the man's suggestion, Hawke's eyes would have
been filled with that subtle, malicious satisfaction; the very same
pleasure that Dodds had seen register during his court-martial, the
moment the guilty verdict had been brought against him. But not now.
He had been denied such delight today and would have to find it
another time, in another place. And preferably with someone else.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds'
eyes were drawn to a crimson-red substance that was gathering just
above the commodore's top
lip and noticed that Hawke's
nose had started to bleed. Hawke, too, became aware of the flow and
rummaged around in a pocket for a handkerchief, producing it just as
a drop of blood slid down from his nose and splattered without a
sound onto the table in front of him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds watched the man
place the handkerchief under his nose and tip his head back,
attempting to control the flow, though Hawke kept his eyes on him as
he did so. It was not as though his nose was gushing, but it was
obvious it was more than a few drops. Dodds found it strange that,
though Parks and Turner looked over to the man to see what the cause
of his sudden discomfort was, they gave it no more than a common
courtesy before they turned back to the starfighter pilot stood
before them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Good. We must press
on gentlemen, time is not a commodity we can currently afford to
waste,” Turner said. “Lieutenant Dodds, I am hereby returning you
to duty. Commodore Parks will brief you shortly.” He gestured to
one of the guards standing by the door who strode forward to Dodds'
side. “Mr Sears here will escort you to a suitable waiting room
where the commodore will meet you. You are dismissed, Lieutenant.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Thank you, sir,”
Dodds said, saluting before replacing his cap, picking up his bag of
meagre belongings and making to leave.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Lieutenant Dodds,”
the admiral's voice called
to him as he crossed the room.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sir?” Dodds
stopped halfway to the door and turned around to face the table
again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“With regard to the
statement that Commodore Hawke gave: whilst the Navy does indeed need
every good pilot it can get, I will have absolutely no qualms
whatsoever with immediately dismissing from service any pilot whose
actions put the lives of others at risk; or whose reckless actions
result in critical mission failures, directly or indirectly. Do not
let your selection into the ATAF project and the early end to your
suspension make you believe you are invincible, Lieutenant. The day
you do a good job, I will be the one to let you know. Do you
understand that?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir. Fully,
sir,” Dodds said, saluted once more and left the meeting room.</P>

<B STYLE="font-size:1.16em;">D</B>odds
jumped to his feet as he heard the door of his assigned waiting room
open, almost spilling the glass of water he held. He stood to
attention and saluted Parks as the man entered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“At ease,
Lieutenant,” Parks said. “Welcome back, Dodds; and welcome to the
Indigo system, I might add.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The room the pair stood
in granted its occupants an appreciative view of the planet below
them, something that Dodds had spent the last half-hour staring out
at. He often made a habit of looking out at the stars, sometimes just
for the view, but frequently because it helped him to think. He found
the often tranquil views to be rather therapeutic.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I trust you had a
good journey here?” Parks said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Uneventful,” Dodds
shrugged.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You stayed out your
entire suspension on Earth?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“With my parents. I
was giving them a hand with the business.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks nodded and his
eyes gave the young man a once-over. “Good to see you didn't
come back soft and completely out of shape after all that time away.
Too many do so after a few weeks of leave.” Parks came to stand
with Dodds by the window and nodded to the planet far below. “Xalan.
Where you will be spending the next three weeks training for the ATAF
project. Myself and Admiral Turner will also be stationed there
during that period to oversee your progress.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Who else will be
there?” Dodds asked, figuring that he would not be the sole
participant in the training program. He had a hunch that his old
wingmates were on the surface.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Aside from yourself
and the <I>White
Knights</I>, there will be two other teams of five who
you will be undergoing the evaluations. At the end of the three-week
period, the team who has successfully completed the evaluation and
passed the final examination will be the one that will go on to pilot
the ATAFs.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Got it,” said
Dodds. Sounded easy enough.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks paused, then
said, “This isn't an individual exercise, Lieutenant. Your success
or failure during these tests will be governed by your ability to
work as a team <I>and
follow orders</I>.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds could feel Parks'
stare boring into him even before he turned around to meet it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Don't
screw this up, Dodds,” Parks said in a stern voice, his mood now a
lot more serious than when he had first entered the room.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I won't,
sir,” Dodds said earnestly. Though Dodds enjoyed a good
relationship with Parks - or maybe it was that the commodore just
tolerated him better than most others - he was still only prepared to
cut the young pilot so much slack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I sure hope you mean
that, Lieutenant,” Parks said, walking towards the door. “Now,
whilst you're here you may
as well attend a medical examination before leaving for Xalan. Your
team mates arrived a few days ago so they will be able to show you
around. You should also know that since your departure we've lost
Wells to an accident during training, as well as your own
replacement. de Winter will introduce you to your new team mate when
you arrive at your assigned housing block.” The door slid open as
Parks approached. He hovered in the doorway, looking back at the
second lieutenant who hadn't moved. “Come on. Get your gear
together, Dodds, we have a lot to get through before we leave.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds picked up his bag
and followed the commodore out, his head swimming with thoughts. It
seemed a lot had happened since he had been away and the multiple
deaths within his flight group had hit home. Not least because of the
casual manner in which Parks had told him about it, as if there were
greater concerns than keeping pilots alive. He wondered what other
pieces of information the commodore might be holding back.</P>

<I>We've
been stationed here at Xalan for three days now and I'm
beginning to feel more settled. There hasn't
been a lot happening so far, but Estelle is making us hit the
simulators for hours on end. She's
really cracking the whip, but I know this is a big thing for her. She
had us on them for sixteen hours yesterday, first thing in the
morning until last thing at night, with barely any time for lunch. I
had to just get in there, shovel it down my throat and get back into
the simulator suite. I thought Estelle was going to choke at the
speed she wolfed hers down! She was acting like she hadn't
eaten for weeks and like she didn't
know where her next meal was coming from! She did the same thing at
dinner, too! I'm sure that's
not healthy. But there again something like this is a once in a
life-time opportunity and she's
determined to do whatever it takes for us to be the first to test out
the Navy's latest creation.
I can't say exactly what it
is here or suffer the consequences.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>We are getting our
first briefing this afternoon and then tomorrow we'll
start our formal training. I don't
know any of the pilots from the others teams, but Estelle seems to
know a girl called Andrea. According to her we were at flight school
together years ago, but I don't
honestly remember. I haven't
seen her about since our arrival, but apparently that's
intentional since they don't
want the teams to all be mixed together.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>We're
in a mixed dormitory here, no separate rooms, so looks like we won't
be getting any ritzy treatment even though we're
involved in a special project. Luckily the room has been designed to
accommodate quite a few people, and since there are only four of us
we have plenty of space; so at least that won't
be a cause of any tension.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>Enrique is just
getting on with it, as he does. With everything that's
going on, he's not really
found the time and space to practice his martial arts or the other
things he does. He was a bit put out that there might not be anyone
to partner with whilst he was here. Being a research facility there
are of course some people here, but I think Enrique was bothered
about “hitting nerds” as he put it.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>Chaz, the new boy
(he's actually a bit older
than us, only known him a few weeks), said he'd
spar with Enrique when they both got some free time, but Estelle soon
put a stop to that. Think she's
getting paranoid that one of them would hurt each other and then not
be able to compete efficiently.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>I'm
still not too sure about Chaz. When he first turned up he introduced
himself and dispensed all the normal pleasantries, but wasn't
too keen on giving anything else away. He keeps his cards very close
to his chest. As far as I can tell it was Commodore Parks'
idea to assign him to our team. We, of course, didn't
get any say in the matter and Estelle was quite concerned. But during
the routine flight exercises before our transfer here he seemed to be
a good fit. He's quiet
though and seems to spend a lot of his time reading. He doesn't
smile a lot either. I don't
honestly imagine I'd have
too much to do with him if he had not been assigned to the White
Knights. He seems to be somewh...</I></P>

As Dodds entered the
room he saw Kelly Taylor stop writing in her digital journal, and
look up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Dodds!” Kelly
said. Dodds had changed out of his uniform for the medical
examination. He now wore a blue naval shirt and dark slacks. The
smart uniform that his mother had pressed and ironed in preparation
for his meeting with three of the CSN's top brass now lay crumpled
somewhere at the bottom of his bag. He had worn it twice in the space
of six months, for the purpose of formal meetings, and was not keen
on putting back on again any time soon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hi, everyone,”
Dodds said, slinging his bag onto a nearby bed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hey, Dodds!” A
tall, sandy blonde-haired man over the other side of the room got up
and strode over to greet his friend. Dodds noticed when he entered
the dormitory that Enrique had been propped up against the back wall,
doing press ups on his head. He was dressed down in a white vest and
thin trousers and Dodds guessed that he was doing the exercises to
let off some steam. Another man, whom Dodds did not recognise,
lowered the book he was reading to get a look at the long absent team
member.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hey, Enrique, how
you doing?” Dodds said, extending a hand.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“They said we should
expect one more person to join the team, but I didn't
expect to see your ugly face around here any time soon,” Enrique
said with a chuckle, greeting his friend with a shake of hands, an
embrace and a hearty slap on the back. “Made it back okay then?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Just,” Dodds
smiled. “I think I would have been on the next shuttle to Earth if
Hawke had had his way. Hadn't been back hardly five minutes before he
was on my back.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Don't
let him wind you up, mate,” Enrique said. He, too, had suffered his
fair share of encounters with the commodore in the past, though in
most cases on account of Dodds, one way or another. If Hawke
possessed a list of personnel in the CSN that he most disliked, the
pair could be certain that they would be tied for the top spot.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hey, how you doing,
Kelly?” Dodds asked of the young woman who was untangling her legs
and crawling off the bed she occupied. Kelly Taylor was a girl of
average height, with a short face, long brown hair and brown eyes.
Dodds often found her quite cute.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm
well, thanks,” Kelly said embracing him and giving him an
affectionate kiss on the cheek. “Nice to have you back.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
If things had changed a
lot within the Navy during Dodds'
absence, then at least he could take comfort in the fact that his
friends had remained the same; although the team had shrunk from its
initial ten members down to five, and there was now a new addition.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Where's
Estelle?” Dodds asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“She'll be back in a
minute. Think she went to check the simulation stats or something,”
Kelly said, rolling her eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Oh, this is Chaz,
the latest addition to the <I>White
Knights</I>,” Enrique indicated the dark-skinned man
who still lay on his bed at the far end of the room, reading. After
briefly acknowledging the appearance of Dodds, he had turned his
attention back to his book, looking quite uninterested in what was
going on. Now, he put the book down and jumped from the top bunk.
Dodds saw that Chaz was not only very tall, but built with it. He
also appeared to prefer to shave his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Pleased to finally
meet you, Dodds,” he said, joining the others. “My name's
Koonan; Chaz Koonan. Only been with the team for a few weeks, but
I've heard a lot about you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Nothing good, I
hope,” Dodds replied with a wry smile, shaking the massive hand
that Chaz extended towards him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Estelle assures me
that you're a fine pilot,”
Chaz said, dodging Dodds'
attempt to engage him in some comedic banter. There was something in
the man's voice that Dodds
could not put his finger on. It was not unfriendly, but somehow
neutral and a little indifferent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Where have you been
transferred from?” Dodds asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That's
a long story...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, and not one we
currently have time for,” a voice came from the doorway. A slender
woman with long, jet black hair that fell over her shoulders stood at
the entrance to the dormitory. Her attire was a close match to that
of Enrique's, a small white
vest and black trousers. In her hands, she clasped a number of sheets
of paper.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hi, Estelle. How are
you?” Dodds said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm
well,” she answered, somewhat pertly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Good...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Uh huh. Could I have
a word with you out here?” she indicated out the door and then left
the dormitory. Dodds looked at the others, who shrugged and then
dispersed back to what they were doing before he arrived. Frowning,
Dodds followed Estelle out of the small housing block they had been
assigned to, incensed at the way she had spoken to him within the
first minute of being reunited.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hey...” Dodds
called after her, stepping out into the warm morning sun. Estelle
turned around to meet his confused expression, her own a picture of
happiness. She walked back to him and put her arms around the man,
giving him a tight hug.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I've
missed you,” she said. “I didn't
think you were ever going to come back.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds didn't
know what to do, though a few moments later he hugged her back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“After you were
suspended from duty, I figured you'd
give it a couple of months and then hang up your boots. You've
not been in touch at all.” Estelle broke their embrace, looking up
into his face with a warm genuine smile, her dimples showing up as
she did so.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds said nothing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Did you miss me?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Well... sure I did.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“So why haven't you
been in touch?” She swept some of the hair that had fallen over her
face out of the way.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I needed time to
think. I just wanted to get a clear perspective on my life. What was
all that about?” Dodds asked her, referring to the way she had
yanked him away from the others whilst they were in the process of
catching up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sorry,” Estelle
said. “Right now I want everyone to stay focused on what we're
doing here, and not get caught up in emotional reunions that could
have a negative effect on our progress and training. But it is good
to see you,” she added as Dodds pulled a face. Estelle had a
tendency to put her career before her friends, something that
appeared to not have waned at all during his absence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Let's
walk,” Estelle said. “I'll
show you around and bring you up to speed.” The pair started down
the brick path that led to their housing block, the walkway splitting
and snaking its away all about the research campus to other buildings
and areas contained within.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Good to be back?”
Estelle asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It is, actually,”
Dodds said with a bit of a sigh. “I spent five months on Earth with
my parents, picking apples.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“How's
the business?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Steady. They think
they'll have a good harvest
this year,” Dodds stopped short of telling Estelle about how his
parents had suggested he consider a career change to work their
fields, instead of returning to the Navy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
They made their way
down a set of wide stone steps, leading down to the lower areas of
the campus and towards the main research buildings. The vast majority
of the construction was made up of tall glass buildings. Small trees
and lamp posts lined the paths they walked, complimented by grass.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Men and women dressed
in everything from suits to casual attire and white lab coats walked
past them, chatting to one another, drinking from polystyrene cups
and going about their business.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“How's
it going here?” Dodds asked. Parks had not been too forthcoming
with details, only to let him know of the briefing that afternoon and
the start of the program the following day.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“A little better than
I expected, although there's still room for improvement,” Estelle
said as she leafed through the sheets of paper she was carrying.
Dodds saw that the pages were packed full of graphs, pie charts and
other statistical information, each headed with a different pilot's
name. He noticed she had already attacked them with a red pen,
circling various numbers and writing scruffy and hurried notes.
“We've only been here for
a few days, but the training starts first thing tomorrow morning.
You'll have to get into a
simulator for the rest of the day to get back up to speed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds frowned. “I'm
not sure I'll be as bad as all that.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, Dodds, you will
be,” Estelle said. “There was a guy a few years back who broke
both his legs. When he eventually got back into the seat it took him
weeks to get used to it again. It's not like riding a bike.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds wasn't so sure.
He had doubts that his time out of the cockpit, and away from the
stick, would have impacted his flying standard as much as Estelle was
suggesting.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What did you think
when they picked us to come here?” Dodds asked, changing the
subject.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle gave a small
chuckle. “When they first told us that we were being transferred, I
was worried we were going to get posted to border patrol duty.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That wouldn't
exactly have been much fun.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah. I couldn't
think of anything worse. They've
been shifting people over to the Temper system a lot lately. When did
you actually get back?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Just this morning. I
received a request from Commodore Parks to return to duty yesterday.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That was quick,”
Estelle said. “You must have been pretty keen to get back here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds started to saying
something, then stopped walking.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle studied him for
a moment as he looked about. “What?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds sighed, then
shook his head. “But I had to, didn't I? I have to make amends.”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hmmmmm,” Estelle
scowled for a moment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm being serious,
Estelle. Hardly a day goes by where I don't think about what
happened.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle said nothing,
but looked about the campus. She soon turned back to him, now
appearing a little sympathetic. “How do you plan to do it?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I don't know,”
Dodds shook his head again. “I'll find a way.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Well, if you ask me
you could try just following orders.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>So
I keep being told</I>, Dodds thought.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle said nothing
more on the subject and the pair continued walking. They both knew
that, whilst he was a good pilot, Dodds had a tendency to be
reckless, and it was that recklessness which from time to time led to
undesirable consequences.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle began to point
out some of the buildings on the campus: the housing blocks for the
on site staff; a number of research buildings that they were not
authorised to enter; a large lecture theatre, where they would attend
the ATAF presentation; and a few large, square buildings that housed
the simulators.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Anything interesting
happen whilst I've been
away?” Dodds asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle chuckled. “You
mean aside from what happened to <I>Dragon</I>?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What happened to
it?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle stopped
walking. “You mean no-one's
told you?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds'
initial belief that Estelle was about to regale him with some useless
trivia about the enormous battleship was quashed by the look on the
woman's face. “Told me
what?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It's
been stolen! It hasn't been
seen or heard from for months!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>Dragon</I>?
The battleship?” he looked at her sceptically for a moment. “You're
being serious, aren't you?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle nodded. “Didn't
Parks tell you?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“He seemed...
distracted,” Dodds said, remembering how, after the two had
departed the waiting room, Parks had seemed eager to return to other
business, saying very little. “He didn't
speak to me about anything other than getting through my medical and
getting me down here. What happened?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It disappeared a few
weeks after your court-mar... after you left,” Estelle said. Dodds
noted how she doubled back and skirted around the touchy subject of
his court-martial. Though she had not been on trial herself, he knew
the many hours sitting in the courtroom, delivering evidence and
being cross examined, was not an experience she had relished, wanted
reminding of, or ever wanted to go through again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It just
disappeared?” Dodds said. “That ship's
not exactly small or defenceless. Did someone just take it out of dry
dock?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It happened in
Independent space, near the Independent-Imperial border. From what
I've heard it was a hijacking.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What the hell was it
doing all the way out there?” Dodds asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No-one knows. Seems
that information is classified,” Estelle said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
They came to a tall,
circular fountain, water spraying out of the top. Estelle and Dodds
joined a few people sat around it, enjoying a mid-morning break from
their work, reading and chatting to one another. The two CSN pilots
made sure they put a good amount of space either side of them so they
could talk with a little more privacy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“How do they know
<I>Dragon</I>
was hijacked and nothing else happened to it? Were there any
witnesses or survivors?” Dodds asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Only one: Commodore
Hawke. He was captain at the time. And <I>no</I>,
Dodds, he wasn't involved,”
Estelle put in, as Dodds roll his eyes at the mention of the man's
name. “They found him drifting through Confederation space in an
escape pod, a week after they lost contact with the ship. The pod
didn't have any food, water
or medical supplies, and the stasis capsules had been smashed up.
Hawke himself had been badly wounded and suffering from blood loss.
He was lucky to be alive.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No-one else
survived?” Dodds asked, mystified. Though he had never laid eyes on
the vessel himself, having only seen it in archive footage and
photographs, he knew enough about the Confederation Stellar Navy's
flagship to know that the event of its theft was quite worrisome.
<I>Dragon</I> was the
largest and most powerful starship in existence, second to none.
Owing to its size, firepower, starfighter and troop capacities, its
mere arrival within a battle zone had been known to cause the
opposing forces to make a hasty retreat or even surrender. Attempting
to fight it was usually never worthwhile. It was so heavily armoured
and shielded that the best defence against it was to be nowhere near
it. If a battle was unavoidable, other capital ships, such as
frigates and carriers, stood a much better chance of survival due to
their own increased capabilities, though it would still be a somewhat
one-sided battle. Dodds knew of only one other ship that stood a
chance of taking on <I>Dragon</I>:
<I>Minotaur</I>,
flagship of the Imperial Naval Forces.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, there weren't
any other survivors, he was the only one,” Estelle said, keeping
her voice low.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Did Hawke tell
anyone what happened?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“He says he can't
remember much before waking up in the escape pod. He recalls a large
boarding party appearing out of nowhere and storming all the major
divisions simultaneously. <I>Dragon</I>
was operating with a full complement, but they were completely
overcome. Hawke believes they were in jump space at the time, so
no-one is sure just how accurate his story is.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“They were in <I>jump</I>?
No, that's... well, it's not impossible, but it's extremely
dangerous. They could have stranded both themselves and <I>Dragon</I>
in the middle of nowhere.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle nodded. “I
find some of it hard to believe.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You're
not the only one. Exactly how did they get aboard in the first place?
Who were these people?” They spoke for a while, discussing the
possibilities, none of which Estelle had not already considered
herself. They concluded that it may have been a faction from the
Imperial civil war, though given <I>Dragon</I>'s
almost legendary status throughout the galaxy, even that seemed
rather far-fetched.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
After sometime, Estelle
suggested to Dodds that they should leave the fountain. They started
walking along the brick pathways, Dodds noting the sizeable wall that
ran the entire perimeter of the campus, effectively shutting it off
from the outside world. Though he had only been at the research
centre a little under an hour, Dodds had counted no less than ten
pairs of armed personnel patrolling the grounds. The young pilot said
nothing as they continued to walk, still trying to put together the
pieces of a large and complicated puzzle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Would have made your
day if Commodore Hawke hadn't
returned either, wouldn't
it?” Estelle commented.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You can't
say you're very fond of the
man yourself,” Dodds replied. Estelle had had her own brushes with
Hawke, either as a result of her own actions or because of those
under her command. Owing to her nature she was much more adept at
handling such meetings, although those methods quite often came under
many variations of “Yes, sir!”, “No, sir!”, “Sorry, sir!”,
and “It won't happen
again, sir!”.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I find it's
best to try and stay on the right side of him,” Estelle said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Which side would
that be?” Dodds enquired.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Just follow the
chain of command, Dodds.” Estelle's voice was close to taking on a
tired and irritable tone. “And please; don't
either you or Enrique start leading each other astray. This is a
fantastic opportunity we've
been granted and we should all act like true professionals.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds decided it was
time to let the topic lie. “So, what's
the new guy like?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Chaz?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah. I spoke to him
before you arrived. He seems a little... distant?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“He's
very quiet,” Estelle mused. Dodds got the impression she was still
trying to figure the man out for herself. “He's
a good pilot, not as good as you or Kelly, but he still gels well
with the team. He used to fly with a group called the <I>Copper
Beetles</I>. His team have been shuffled around. They
assigned him to the <I>Knights</I>
and the others were transferred to Earth.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Guess I'll
get to know him better during the training then,” Dodds remarked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle shook her head.
“Wouldn't bet on it. He's
been with us for three weeks and that's
all I've managed to get out
of him. He's nice though, if
a bit grumpy. Likes to read, too.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The pair had walked a
fair way and Estelle suggested they head back. Dodds asked Estelle
what she knew about the ATAF project, but it seemed that her
knowledge on the subject was as good as his.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">

<P CLASS="western">
Returning to the
dormitory, they found that Enrique, Kelly and Chaz were back in their
original places. The accommodation of the campus was better than
Dodds was used to: the dormitory was bright and spacious and, from
the looks of things, sported much cleaner and improved washing
facilities. He grabbed his bag from the bed and began to sort through
his belonging, pulling things out and dumping them onto the mattress.

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle cleared her
throat in an authoritative manner. She shuffled through the papers in
her hands and then addressed the group as a whole,</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Okay everyone,
listen up. We've still got a
lot to do before tomorrow morning. The simulator results are
extremely positive and we're
all doing much better than we were yesterday on the advanced courses,
but there's still room for improvement. We can get times down,
minimise ally and ammunition losses... Kelly, could you stop writing
for just one second until I have finished speaking, please?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Kelly put down her
digital journal, pushing it down the bed and out of reach for good
measure, before giving the first lieutenant her undivided attention.
Dodds feigned an irritation around his eye, looking away from his
team mates as he saw Estelle's domineering side starting to creep in.
Although Estelle liked to treat those in her command as friends, she
was never afraid to pull rank to get the point across. Things had not
changed much with her over the past five months either then.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“After lunch and the
presentation, I want us to go back over simulation courses A4, A9,
A15 and A19...” Estelle continued.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Enrique groaned and
looked to the windows, at the warm afternoon sun that was streaming
on through.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We're
not here on vacation, Enrique,” Estelle snapped at the man. “In
fact, Dodds, you need to get on those sims ASAP to work out the rust.
Enrique will go with you and give you a hand setting up.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Enrique stifled another
groan and pulled himself to his feet. “Come on, man, let's go,”
he indicated to Dodds as he walked over to join him. Estelle
flourished a red pen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I've not been over
everything,” she said, tapping the papers. “But I'm sure after
I'm done with these we'll be able to...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'll
go, too,” Chaz announced, swinging his legs off his bunk and
jumping down. “I've never
flown with Dodds before, so the sooner I see what he can do, the
better we can exploit our strengths and cover our weaknesses.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle held a bemused
look as the big man hurried towards Dodds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah, good point,”
Kelly said. “I think that having more familiar wingmates will help
Dodds to get back up to speed much sooner than... uh... unfamiliar
ones.” She hopped off her bed, and squeezed herself between Enrique
and Chaz to get to Dodds, taking one of the man's
arms and herding him out the quarters. “No time to waste now!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Behind them, Enrique
and Chaz hurried along and the four bustled out the dormitory, past
Estelle who watched them go with a flabbergasted expression on her
face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'll
meet you in the simulation suite just before lunch,” Estelle called
after them as they disappeared down the corridor, towards the exit of
the housing block.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, don't
worry, we'll meet you in the
refectory,” Kelly called back without turning around. “That was a
close one,” she said in a low voice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah, tell me
about,” Enrique said, then turned to Dodds. “Seriously, mate, I
can't believe she used to be your girlfriend.”</P>

<B STYLE="font-size:1.16em;">T</B>he
simulator suite to which Dodds was escorted was contained within a
large square glass building, its central expansive floor home to a
large number of the systems. Each simulator itself was self
contained, to guard against any visual distractions. The interior of
each was an exact replica of the designated craft, with readouts and
consoles all working as expected.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
For the most part, the
shiny white suite floor was devoid of anything except for the
modules, whilst a high gallery of observation rooms and offices ran
around the perimeter. Staff milled around inside, performing various
tasks. After explaining their requirements to a staff member, Enrique
and Dodds made their way over to a TAF module.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds sat down in the
seat and buckled himself in, the screens inside powering up to
display a convincing astral scene all around him. The HUD activated
and control consoles lit up as they prepared themselves. A sense of
familiarity came back to Dodds. He reached forward and expertly
configured the fighter's HUD
to the way he preferred, before informing the simulation operator
that he was ready to begin.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
To his dismay, Dodds
found that he was, just as Estelle had predicted, somewhat rusty on
the simulator. The months away from duty had led to him forgetting
some of the more intricate principles of space flight and combat, and
he found himself stalling from time to time. But he focused and an
hour later he was well on the way to returning to his original form.
He embarked on a series of courses, each designed to work on various
aspects of his skills, from flight handling to basic target practice.
After sometime, Enrique, Kelly and Chaz joined him on a simple
training mission, working as a team to fulfil various objectives.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds discovered during
the course of the exercise that Chaz's
alleged silence made the transition to the cockpit, and whilst the
others would engage in all kinds of genial banter and teasing, Chaz's
voice lent itself only when it was required of him. Despite this,
Dodds found that the man was an accomplished pilot and worked well
with the rest of the team.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The mission took the
best part of an hour to complete, by which time they were all
grateful for a break and some food.</P>

Making their way into
the refectory after Estelle joined them, Dodds felt quite out of
place, the five pilots being the only military personnel present. The
tables were packed full of casual and suit attired staff, a
smattering of white coats here and there. More walked around carrying
their meals on trays.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Is there anyone else
here?” Dodds asked as he sat down to eat whatever delights Xalan's
research staff were given for lunch. He had yet to see any other
servicemen and couldn't help but feel that he was missing out on
something.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Two other teams,”
Estelle said, confirming what Parks had told him earlier, whilst
holding up a fork full of mashed potatoes, dripping in gravy. “But
we're being kept apart;
something about the segregation enabling us to function better as a
team and provide us with fewer distractions.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sure it will,”
Dodds replied as an attractive, petite brunette brushed past his
chair, their eyes meeting for a brief moment. She looked away, but
smiled as she continued walking.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle tutted before
going on to question Dodds as to his performance on the simulators
for the rest of the meal, asking every conceivable question about his
progress. She was quite disappointed to discover he had not brought
back any analytics.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Finishing, the team
stashed their trays on a rack and left the refectory, Estelle
steering them in the direction of the central lecture theatre to
attend the presentation.</P>

The lecture theatre,
like the other areas of the facility Dodds had visited that day, had
a far larger capacity than their needs demanded. Positioned centrally
in the rows of red steepled seating, and close to the front, were ten
other people, who must have been the other teams.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Ah, you must be...
um... you are.. the <I>White
Knights</I>?” a voice boomed out over the theatre
speakers. A tall suited man stood behind the podium at the front,
with his back to a large screen covering the wall. To one side of him
sat two other men, one of whom was Parks. “If you're
all ready then... er.. please take your seats and I will begin the...
the presentation.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Come on, come on,”
Estelle muttered, ushering her team into their seats.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Estelle, we're
early, relax,” Dodds said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah, about fifteen
minutes early,” Kelly said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, but the other
teams are already here,” Estelle replied, before insisting on
dictating the seating arrangement so that she could sit herself in
the middle of the team.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds was already
beginning to feel sorry for the others, having had to put up with her
perfection-seeking attitude for three intense days already. Sadly, he
knew that with their formal training starting the following day, it
was going to get a lot worse before it got any better. And should
they succeed in the evaluations and have the opportunity to pilot
these new starfighters, Estelle could become unbearable.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Now,” began the
lecturer, “may I first welcome you to the Obex Research Centre here
on Xalan and er... tulate... all...” His words became inaudible
through his mumbling. The speaker looked around as Parks said
something to him. He cleared his throat and went on.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“...congratulate you
all on your selection to become the first to pilot the
Confederation's newest and
most advanced starfighter... um... My my my name is James Ainsworth
and... er... I am the chief engineer on the ATAF project. This is
Scott Mansun,” he indicated to the man seated just behind him, “the
project leader, and you all know Commodore Parks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Right, um... I know
you'll probably have a lot more questions, b... but, if you could
hold off from asking them... erm... until the end of the
presentation, and then Scott will... will gladly take them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Probably a good
idea,” Dodds whispered to Enrique, sat next to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Ainsworth studied the
podium for a moment, appearing unsure about how it operated. He
pushed a button and then jumped when it did not do as he had
expected: his microphone cutting off and classical music beginning to
stream in through the hall's speakers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Oh God, this is
going to take hours...” Enrique murmured, as a befuddled Ainsworth,
aided by Mansun, attempted to regain control of his presentation.
There were some stifled chuckles from the other teams and Dodds
wondered what Ainsworth must be like when the lecture theatre was
full.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Ainsworth was a tall,
thin-looking man with pasty white skin. His head was covered in lank,
long blond hair that fell just short of his shoulders. A gold earring
sparkled in the light as he turned his head. Dodds got the impression
that he was the sort of man who had never quite found the strength to
sever his ties with his earlier hedonistic years, even after
embarking on what seemed like quite an illustrious career.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I... I'm sorry about
that,” Ainsworth said as the music ceased. “I'm not used to this
theatre.” With the presentation back in his control, Ainsworth
pressed the correct buttons on the podium and the lights began to
dim.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds looked over at
the other teams as the light level lowered, seeing that, unlike the
<I>White Knights</I>, the
other two teams were both single-sex. Five men and five women were
seated together and Dodds wondered if this was again part of the team
selection. Maybe the Navy wished to discover if a single-sex team was
more suited to the project and its long term goals. But there again,
it could just be pure coincidence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
There was not one face
amongst the team of women that he recognised. One turned her head in
his direction, a contented smile on her face. She did not meet his
eyes, however, and faced back to the front. He guessed she was doing
the same thing that he was: sizing up the competition. Neither did he
recognise any of the men; two olive-skinned men seated at the end of
their row were whispering to each other.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The lights didn't shut
off, but instead dipped only to a level in which they did not drown
out the presentation screen at the front. Dodds hoped that he would
not find himself with an elbow in the ribs from Estelle after falling
asleep. He felt as though he was in a warm, comfortable cinema and he
sensed the impending danger, even more so after such a filling lunch.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Ladies and
gentlemen, I give you the Advanced Tactical Assault Fighter, more
commonly known as the ATAF,” Ainsworth began. “It is the... er...
spiritual successor to the standard Tactical Assault Fighter which
you all know so well, though with many enhancements as... as we are
about to see. I'm sure that you will find the following presentation
t-t-to be both very informative and impressive.”</P>

The presentation
started, the screen showing a sleek, black starfighter moving against
a backdrop of planets, nebulas and starships. It appeared to be a
mixture of artists'
impressions and real footage of the fighter, as it weaved its way
around other Confederation starfighters.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
There were no official
markings or identifiers on the craft, the black armour complimented
only by silver trims on the wings, fins and body. Despite being more
or less black, the definition of the fighter was not lost against the
inky-darkness of space, the armour catching the light and softly
reflecting the environment about it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With the introduction
over, Ainsworth went on to speak at length about the new fighter. He
was keen to point out that the ATAF, though descended from, was quite
different from its TAF cousin and was not just “a TAF with more
guns”, as he put it. Over the next two hours, he detailed each and
every aspect of the craft, focusing on enhancements which he thought
the pilots would find most appealing: a HUD that featured a
predictive targeting matrix, allowing the pilot to aim for where
their opponent would be,
rather than where they were; an
arsenal that was made up of significantly more powerful armaments
than its predecessor; a much higher acceleration rate and top speed;
and a shield generation unit that was many times more efficient.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
The detail of the each
enhancement was accompanied by video footage, some of it set planet
side, the rest in space. Whatever the backdrop, most involved
something exploding in rather dramatic fashion.</P>

With
his presentation concluded, Ainsworth thanked his audience and moved
away from the podium. No-one had attempted to ask any questions, but
Dodds noticed that all around him people were gaping; all that
was, with the exception of Chaz. The big man had sat through most of
the presentation with a deadpan expression on his face, slouched down
a little in his seat and his arms folded across his chest. He didn't
look all that interested or even impressed at what he was being
shown. Dodds wondered why. At the very least, he would have expected
to see a flicker of curiosity. Maybe he held the same point of view
as Dodds: something about this didn't look right.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
“Dude, I'm finding
this a little hard to swallow,” Dodds whispered in Enrique's ear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
“Which part?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
“Which part? Well,
where do I start? The bit about the accelerator or that that
flimsy-looking crate is better shielded than most of our carriers.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
“It's just the next
evolutionary step up,” Enrique said. “They make these sorts of
advancements all the time. You can bet they're already working on the
successor to that one in a lab somewhere else, too.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
Dodds frowned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
“You've gotta admit,
those things look pretty sweet,” Enrique added, with a nod towards
the screen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
“You know, my Dad has
a saying - <I>Never believe everything you hear, and only half of
what you see</I>.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
“I don't think this
is one of those cases, mate.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Okay,
well, imagine this...” Dodds started. With all that they had
heard that afternoon, this starfighter, when compared to any other,
was in essence the equivalent of taking an ordinary ground soldier
and strapping a tank cannon to their back. Said soldier would then be
given a belt holding two dozen grenades, before being presented with
two shotguns, two pistols and two machine guns. Not only would all
the added weight be of no consequence to their ability to walk or
otherwise move, nor in any way hinder their performance on the
battlefield, but they would be able to run at the speed of a top
class athlete and survive being shot many, many times before they
were at last brought down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds hoped the image
of such a man leaping, somersaulting and sprinting through a torn,
urban landscape would look so ludicrous, as to sway Enrique's
opinion. It didn't.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Questions?”
Mansun, having taken to the podium, asked. A flurry of hands went up,
none of which belonged to Dodds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, you. The young
lady in the middle there.” A rather striking, tall woman with curly
blonde hair stood up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“First Lieutenant
Andrea Kennedy, <I>Red
Devils</I>, sir,” she introduced herself. “I'm
aware that I'm probably about to ask the same question as everyone
else -” she looked around briefly “- but I have to know: how it
is possible that you have managed to outfit a single man starfighter
with a plasma accelerator? I mean, we're talking about a weapon that
is usually only found on cap ships and orbital defence platforms;
something capable of cleaving a passenger vessel in two, with ease.
The power requirements must be astronomical!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>Yes, how </I>did<I>
you do that?</I> Dodds wondered. <I>That's not technically possible.</I>
A part of him was intrigued, but another part of him was feeling a
little uneasy. A three-dimensional image of the ATAF was continuing
its idle rotation on the screen behind Mansun and he couldn't help
but feel that he was looking upon something that shouldn't be;
shouldn't <I>need</I> to be.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I thought you might
want to know that,” Mansun answered Andrea with a wry smile. “But
unfortunately I can't
provide any more information right now. Let's just say that we have
access to some of the best architects and engineers that the galaxy
can currently offer. As a comparison, you must remember that we are
also able to travel a distance of many hundred light years in the
space of only a few hours, something that was also considered
impossible until you knew the trick.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Well, I have to say
that I‘m <I>very</I>
impressed,” Andrea beamed. “You and your engineers have done an
absolutely incredible job.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Thank you,” Mansun
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“And may I just add,
on behalf of myself and my team, that it will be an honour to
evaluate the Advanced Tactical Assault Fighter for the benefit of the
Navy,” Andrea said, with another radiant smile that was now
mimicked by her team mates. “Thank you for giving us this
opportunity.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Mansun gave a small
chuckle, but did not answer. The project leader clasped at the back
of his neck with one hand and turned in the direction of the still
seated Parks. He was clearly a little embarrassed and was attempted
to avoid eye contact with his admirer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds looked over at
Andrea again as the woman settled back down into her seat. He found
her quite beautiful, with sharp features and smooth white skin. Even
now, she continued to wear that very attractive smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Mansun gave a cough and
collected himself. “Any other questions?” he requested. “If not
then I will wrap up this portion of the presentation and move on to
the program for the next three weeks.” A few more hands went up
from all three teams, with various questions aimed at elaborating
more on various aspects of the starfighter. After answering a good
number, Mansun decided it was best to press on, lest they spend the
remainder of the afternoon stuck in the lecture hall.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm
sure any other questions that you may have will be answered once the
training begins tomorrow morning,” he concluded and began to
discuss the schedule for the following days'
training and eventual graded evaluations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Leaving the theatre,
herded once more by Estelle in her eagerness to get back the
simulation suite, Dodds was left with one question that he had
refrained from asking. It seemed to him that the Confederation was
preparing to push the bounds of military force and technology in ways
that had not been heard of for centuries; even more so during
peacetime. His question was “Why?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:center;">
*

<P CLASS="western">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">
Dodds found the initial
few days of the training quite straightforward. The group arrived at
their simulation suite and were taken through a number of basic
flight programs. The simulated ATAF cockpit layout was quite similar
to that of a TAF and it did not take long for the team to get used to
it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Contrary to what
Ainsworth had said, Dodds did feel that he really was flying a “TAF
with more guns”, and it was not long before Estelle began
pressuring the group to move on to more advanced techniques.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As the days progressed,
the learning curve began to increase, until they
came to realise that more than a week had passed
and they were beginning their first ungraded training exercise. As
with the standard simulator tests, they were required to undertake a
series of missions, though within vastly inflated constraints: a
simple dogfight against six opponents ballooned into a struggle
against over three dozen; the enemy supply line hit morphed into a
strike run against an Imperial frigate, complete with escorts; and
their own escort mission transformed into a monstrous operation
involving the protection of a crippled carrier against an onslaught
of opposing forces.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Had the <I>Knights</I>
been flying anything other than ATAFs, many of the tasks would have
proven next to impossible. As it was, the benefits provided by the
fighter permitted the pilots a much greater fighting chance; though
not always.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“A rather unrealistic
combat simulation,” the training supervisor assured them upon the
team's first failure. “Doubtful that such a situation would ever
arise in real life. When you're
ready, you can attempt the mission again. Remember that most capital
ships have some structurally vulnerable points. If you focus your
attacks against those, then you should be able to bring it down with
relative ease.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds clambered out of
his module, the scene of the carrier breaking up still projecting
itself about the interior. The cannons of the frigate they were
supposed to be defending it from were still ravaging the surface as
he joined Estelle by the training supervisor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Can we use the
accelerators?” Estelle asked, trying to do something about her
ruffled hair. Even though they had failed on their very first
attempt, it was clear she was already becoming frustrated, wanting
nothing more than to succeed on the first attempt, with flying
colours. Dodds felt his shoulders sag and he turned wearily to
Enrique, who let out a sigh, lowered his eyes to the floor and shook
his head. Kelly also appeared drained, even more so than Chaz, both
of their eyes starting to turn red. The strain of the non-stop
exercises, staring at a screen for well over an hour at a time, and
having to concentrate hard on everything was taking its toll. It was
a long time to sit in a cockpit, simulator or not, without a break.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, I'm sorry,”
the training manager shook his head. “But whilst they were a part
of your initial training and familiarisation, the accelerators aren't
a part of these ungraded exercises, or the final evaluations, I'm
afraid. Should you successfully complete the evaluation, and set
yourselves apart from the other teams, then you may have a chance to
use them during real life training.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle made sure the
<I>Knights</I>
succeeded on the next attempt.</P>

After many hours spent
in the modules, the final few days were upon them and arriving at the
simulation suite the group were met by Commodore Parks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Good morning,
<I>Knights</I>,”
he greeted them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Good morning,
Commodore,” Estelle saluted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“As you were. As I'm
sure you're well aware, today will see the beginning of your last
three days at this facility and also the first day of your graded
evaluations. Regardless of the outcome of these tests, you will be
transferred to Xalan's
Orbital to await further instruction. Your destination from there
will be determined by your performance here; and I have to say,
Lieutenant de Winter, that so far your team has performed far better
in these evaluations than any of the others. I am expecting good
things from you over the next few days. Good luck, <I>Knights</I>.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Thank you, sir,”
Estelle said, saluting the commodore once more as he left the suite.
Estelle turned to her team, her eyes bright.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Okay, everyone. This
is it. Let's give it all
we've got.”</P>

<P CLASS="western">
Four days later the
<I>White
Knights</I> stood before Parks, Ainsworth and Mansun in
a meeting room aboard Xalan's
orbital station. As they waited before the commodore, Dodds glanced
momentarily to Estelle, seeing the woman almost bursting with pride.
She caught his eye and gave him a wink.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks looked up. “I
will keep this brief,” he began. “Your performance throughout the
entire evaluation period has been nothing less than exceptional; you
exceeded expectations in almost every exercise.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Thank you, sir,”
Estelle said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks' face remained
expressionless. “However, compared with the final test results of
the other teams, you did not perform as favourably. I realise that
this is not the news that any of you wished to hear after all the
effort you have put in, and on no account should you hold each other
to blame for this,” his eyes flickered to Estelle. “I'm
sorry to say that as far as your participation in the ATAF project is
concerned, you will not be proceeding any further.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle was devastated,
that much was obvious to Dodds, even above the poker face that she
had practised for years. Inside she must have been distraught.
Enrique and Kelly disguised their feelings less well, disappointment
written all over their faces. Rather strange, however, was that
despite the fact that Chaz had put one hundred and ten percent into
the ATAF evaluations, the big man didn't seem bothered about the end
of their participation in the project. In fact he almost looked –
relieved?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks continued. “This
is by no means a reflection on your abilities; unless you were of a
high calibre, you would not have been selected in the first place.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Thank you, sir,”
Estelle said, somehow managing to keep the disappointment out of her
voice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds, Enrique and
Kelly echoed her words. Dodds had half expected another speech from
Estelle, mimicking Andrea's speech in the lecture theatre and
thanking the commodore for the opportunity to have taken part, but
she said nothing more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Guess we're all
heading back to Gabriel then?” Enrique said, half to Parks and half
to his team mates.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Actually, Mr Todd,
from here all five of you will be transferred to the Temper
system...” Parks began.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>What</I><I>?</I>”
Chaz said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds jumped at the
sound of the man's voice.
Not least of all because he was not that used to hearing it, but also
because of the sheer anger that seemed to flow from the man like red
hot magma. He turned to look at the man, though he subconsciously
leaned away. Chaz's eyes were narrowed, his face furious. He was
almost shooting daggers at the commodore sat before him. Dodds
glanced to his team mates, noticing that they appeared every bit as
surprised at the man's sudden outburst. Kelly, in particular, looked
like a scared rabbit. On the other side of the desk, a shocked
Ainsworth had begun tense fidgeting, looking with apprehension over
to Mansun.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“The <I>border</I>?”
Enrique said, once the shock of Chaz's
outburst had subsided enough for the added impact of the new
destination to sink in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, Mr Todd, the
Confederation-Independent border,” Parks continued, ignoring Chaz.
“As you have been told before we are currently suffering from a
lack of personnel, and thus an inadequate supply of experienced
starfighter pilots. You also need to remember that we are still
counting the cost of the theft of <I>Dragon</I>.
It's not just the loss of
the battleship that's troublesome, but the disappearance of virtually
all who were serving aboard. Those numbers include several hundred
starfighter pilots, all of the highest calibre that the Confederacy
could offer; a figure that, as I'm
sure you can well imagine, doesn't
replenish itself overnight, nor even within six months.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Your experience and
skills will therefore be invaluable within the Temper system. Given
all that we cannot afford to have you stationed anywhere else at this
time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“This is just in the
short-term, sir?” Kelly ventured.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks shook his head.
“No. Until further notice, you will be posted to Spirit, where you
will fall under the general command of Captain Meyers. Preparations
for your departure to the system have already been made, and your
transport will be ready to go within the next quarter of an hour.
Please ensure you are ready to leave at that time.” The man's
voice had an edge of finality to it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Spirit. Dodds racked
his brain to remember it. He then discovered why he had buried it so
deep: the planet was supposedly run down and dilapidated, nothing
about it at all very appealing, not even the “notable” parts.
Certain Confederation planets that were home to military interests
were wrapped with a large orbital ring. Spirit's
had been under construction for many years, but had never been
completed. It had fallen into disrepair as a result. The orbital
station that hung above the planet
was all there was to service the CSN's needs and was almost
unable to handle the demands placed upon it. Dodds suppressed a
feeling of horror. What had he agreed to come back to?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Mansun stepped forward.
“On behalf of the research and development teams at Xalan, I would
like to thank you all for your work in helping us evaluate the ATAF,”
he said, shaking their hands in turn. When he came to Chaz he let out
a yelp, a clear look of discomfort on his face. Chaz's eyes were
still narrowed and he looked to have a very tight grip on the man's
hand. Mansun retreated back, nursing his injured fingers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, I... er...
would also like to thank you,” Ainsworth said. “Erm... than...
thank you.” He gave a little wave, but refused to move away from
the safety of the desk. Parks looked to him, but Ainsworth only gave
a very slight shake of his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks turned back to
the <I>Knights</I>.
“Before you go: I shouldn't
have to remind you that even though you are no longer active
participants within the ATAF project the project is still
classified,” he stated bluntly. “As before, none of you are to
discuss your involvement or knowledge of the starfighter; it doesn't
exist. Your personal records and other assignment papers will state
that you have just transferred from Wolf 359 where you were working
to ensure continued security of Naval interests.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That is all, <I>White
Knights</I>, you are dismissed. You will be informed
when your transport arrives. Until then, please remain in your
assigned waiting room; security will see you out. If there is
anything you need before your departure, then please inform a member
of personnel.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The same tone of
finality was still present as Parks finished and Dodds could not help
but feel as if the commodore was blaming them for something. With
some reluctance, the <I>Knights</I>
saluted and turned to leave.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Man, I can't believe
they're sending us to Spirit,” Enrique grumbled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It must be some sort
of mistake,” Kelly said. “They surely won't keep us there for
more than a few weeks...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Is there a problem,
Mr Koonan?” Parks' voice came from some way behind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds looked around to
discover that, whilst the others had walked towards the door, where a
couple of members of security were waiting to escort them away, Chaz
had remained rooted to the spot. He was staring down at Parks and,
from the concerned look on Ainsworth's
face, he was not in the best of moods. Mansun, too, had taken a small
step backwards in retreat, away from the big man who seemed to be
radiating fury.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Enrique started back,
but Kelly grabbed his arm, holding him with the others. From what
Dodds had gathered, whilst Enrique maintained a better relationship
with Chaz than anyone else, it was doubtful that he would be able to
handle the man in his current state. The two security guards
exchanged a quick look with one another, and their hands poised over
the pistols at their belts, ready to move in in case of trouble.
Parks remained sat at his desk, twiddling a pen in hand and staring
unflinching back up into Chaz's
enraged expression, his own quite still and impassive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, <I>sir</I>,”
Chaz said after a time, in a cold, bitter tone, the hands at his
sides balled into tight fists.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Good. Please don't
keep your transport waiting, Lieutenant,” Parks answered, now
meeting Chaz's glare with a
stern look of his own.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With that, and without
saluting, Chaz turned on his heel and marched out the door, past his
four wingmates and the two security guards. He acknowledged none of
them as he went, his brow furrowed, his eyes blazing, his fists still
clenched firmly. They looked around to the commodore.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Please escort the
<I>Knights</I>
to where they will await transport,” Parks prompted security,
before turning his attention to some paperwork in front of him.</P>

“Is Spirit really
that bad?” Kelly asked Enrique, eyes on Chaz, as security led them
to their assigned waiting room. Ahead of her, Dodds put his arm
around Estelle, but she shrugged him off without a word, apparently
preferring to wallow in her own misery. Chaz still strode ahead of
the group, alone.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I don't
think that's what's
upset him,” Enrique replied.</P>

a surly expression, Estelle marched to the rear of the transport

<I>Knights</I>
and choosing instead to
stare out the window. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Dodds
attempting to get her attention, before giving up and settling down
into a seat further up the shuttle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With the ejection from
the ATAF project and her dreams in tatters, Estelle felt that her
life was just about over. The greatest opportunity of her career,
gone; just like that. She tried to remind herself that there was
always someone, somewhere who was worse off than she; though right
now she was having trouble picturing it.</P>

<P CLASS="western">
At the edge of Imperial
space, Natalia Grace had dragged a barely conscious, dying man down
the corridors of her stricken vessel for what seemed like an
eternity, doing her best to avoid the flames that continued to erupt
all around her. Twice, she had been forced to change her route to
reach the escape pods. The smoke was starting to thicken now, making
it difficult to see and breathe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
To make matters worse,
the man she struggled to bring with her had fought against her
throughout the journey, attempting to shake her off. He had shouted
at her to leave him, but she had insisted on bringing him with her.
The man's clothes were
bloodied, ripped and burnt in several places, the flesh beneath raw
and charred. Natalia did not know the man's
name and he had been unable to tell her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Finally, she had made
it to the escape pods. The ship that burned around her was not a
large vessel and there were only a handful of pods to serve the crew.
Here, there were just two. Both of them remained, none of the other
crew - if any were still alive - having made it this far. Natalia had
encountered numerous bodies along the way and it appeared that she
and the man she had fought to bring with her were the last two people
remaining alive on the ship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The vessel gave a
sudden, violent lurch, knocking Natalia off her feet. She struggled
to stand as it continued to vibrate and shudder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>What
the hell was that?</I> she thought.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“... sh... ship's
coming apart...” the voice of her unknown companion answered her
thoughts, still lying on the floor where he had been deposited. Now
that he appeared to be at least semi-conscious and talkative, Natalia
hauled him over a bulkhead and, with some effort, managed to help him
up into a sitting position. His breathing was heavy and rattling.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“... you've gotta get
into... one of... those quickly,” he told her, gasping and staring
at the escape pods. Natalia tried to help him stand, but he cried out
in pain, pushing her away as best he could.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Please, you have to
get up!” she begged him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“... i can't,”
he whined back to her. “i can hardly... even breathe.” He looked
into her eyes. “You have to go! Now!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, I can't
go on my own!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“... if you don't
leave soon... this ship will come apart... and you'll
be sucked out into space... unless they decide to finish it off
before then... you know they will... you, more than anyone... should
know that... this... this ship is useless... to them now... they'll
come for you when they're
done with the others.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Natalia knew he was
right. The only reason their attackers had not destroyed the ship
already was because they were tackling those who were still putting
up a fight, and her own vessel was dead in the water. But as soon as
they became aware that it was no longer usable, and not-at-all
salvageable, they wouldn't hesitate to blow it to pieces.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I can't
go on my own,” Natalia repeated, tears streaming down her face. “I
wouldn't know where to go or
what to do. I've never flown
a ship, let alone attempted to navigate in jump space.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Through the flickering
light, she could see a smile spread across the man's
face. “... didn't... think
you wanted me for my wit or good looks,” he said, attempting not to
cough blood over her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Natalia
smiled back, though hers was filled with sadness. She knelt
close to him and took his head in her hands, kissing him on the
forehead.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“... in my top pocket
is... my id card... please make sure it gets to my wife.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I will, I promise.”
Natalia took the id card from him - it revealed his name to be David
S. Porter - and slipped it into a zipped inner pocket of her jacket.
She recalled the man now: he was always telling jokes to lift the
spirits of all of those around him. He'd made her smile on a number
of occasions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
She double-checked to
ensure that all her other important data cards were safe and secure
and still with her, before opening the door to one of the escape pods
and stepping across the threshold. After everything that she had been
through, she could not afford to get away only to leave all the
reports behind. She could not remember all of what she had seen and
done, and many others' hard
work had been entrusted to her. She could not let them down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
From the rear doors,
she could see straight through the pod to the cockpit windows at the
front, the launch chutes of the main vessel open, revealing the vast
emptiness of space beyond. It was then that she noticed the ship was
spinning. Every now and again, scenes of the on-going battle would
enter into her view, burnt-out debris from other craft tumbling by in
the immediate outside space.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“... can you still
see... the jumpgate?” she heard Porter ask behind her, his voice
weak.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, yes I can,”
Natalia replied. “But it looks like we're
moving away from the entry point. I'm
sure we were closer to it than that.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“... it's
not getting... further away... it's...
getting smaller because it's
closing... soon it will be unusable... you'll...
have to hurry.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Natalia hesitated. The
thought of piloting a spacecraft, no matter what type, made her sick
to her stomach; like attempting to cross a vast ocean, on a small
raft using nothing but her own arms for paddles. Looking around the
pod an idea struck her and she scampered back to Porter's
side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“... i can't
come with you,” he managed again, as she tried to help him up once
more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I can put you in one
of the stasis capsules!” she enthused. “You'll
be fine once you're under.
And once we get to the other end, we can get you some medical
assistance.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Porter shook his head.
“... those ones aren't...
military-grade... they don't
work like that... they just make you fall asleep... i'll
die in there... and then you'll
have to put up with a rotting corpse... until you get picked up.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Natalia looked in
anguish from her dying companion to the open pod.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“... the controls are
clearly marked,” he assured her. “... the pods are designed to be
simple to use... smart girl like you... should have no trouble
working it out...” he coughed uncontrollably and there was more
blood.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The ship rocked again,
the shaking accompanied by a terrible grinding sound.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Go!” Porter
mustered enough strength to put emphasis on the word.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Natalia rushed back
into the tiny, cramped pod, past the stasis capsules that lay like
small beds opposite one another, and up to the front. She studied the
control panel in the cockpit and discovered it was indeed very basic
and straightforward. There was even a brass plate with engraved
launch instructions on the main console. As Natalia looked out for
the jump point a thought occurred to her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“How can I reach the
jump point with the ship spinning?” she asked, returning yet again
to the pod's rear doors.
David did not answer her; he was dead. The man's
eyes were closed and he was slumped forward, quite still.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Natalia felt her heart
rate increase, her breath coming quick. She was alone. Wasting no
further time she hurried to the front of the pod and began working
through the instructions on the plate one by one, pressing buttons
and activating systems in the specified order. Behind her the rear
doors closed and locked. As she continued various instruments sprang
into life, screens and monitors lit up and started to tail system
logs, statuses of essential parts and other texts. The final
instructions on the engraved plate read,</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:center; background: #ffffff;">
Press 'Release'
to release locking clasps</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:center;">
Press 'Launch'
to fire engines</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:center;">

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Looking down the launch
chute Natalia realised what she had to do and pressed the release
button whilst studying the spinning scene outside. The now tiny jump
point was coming into her view from bottom to top. The vessel was not
spinning very fast, but her inexperience with starships had hit her
confidence. She swore as she missed the second spin... and the third.
On the fourth pass of the jump point, when it was more or less
central in her view, Natalia pressed the launch button. She felt the
engines engage and the pod shot forward. The jump point was now
smaller than ever and she prayed that by the time she reached it, it
would not have closed completely.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Looking behind her to
the tiny rear door window, she caught a glimpse of what remained of
the ship she had been travelling on. Compulsion overtook her and she
moved over to the small viewport.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As David had said, her
old ship was coming apart, small pieces breaking off all the time,
severing the links between the larger sections. Around the vessel,
Natalia could make out Imperial starfighters weaving between other
stricken craft, explosions ripping across their hulls.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Her ships, her allies,
her friends. She would never see them again. The tears came afresh
and through her blurred vision she caught sight of an Imperial
frigate reigning over the carnage. As she watched, she saw a
starfighter deviate from its current course and move towards her pod.
Her tears of sorrow became ones of fear and she gave a loud gasp. The
starfighter approached and Natalia found she was unable to tear her
eyes away from it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Two green bolts of
plasma issued from beneath its wings. Her pod was bathed in a
brilliant light. Moments later, the exploding, stricken vessels, the
frigate, and the fighter were gone, to be replaced by the blue haze
of jump space.</P>

“I think the <I>Red
Devils</I> must have cheated. You saw the way Andrea
was sucking up during that presentation. She was probably doing stuff
like that the whole way through the evaluation,” Estelle continued
to chew on the bone of the <I>Knights'</I>
exit from the ATAF project.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The others said
nothing, having since taken to just ignoring her. Enrique was
slouched in his chair asleep; Chaz was back to his book; Kelly was
taking the time to write in her journal; and Dodds was back to his
favourite activity of staring out the window. The view was quite
uninspiring, with nothing to see aside from jump space's
blue haze.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle's
misery was further compounded by the fact that the transport the five
now occupied was likely the last luxury they would be afforded before
arriving at Spirit. It could comfortably hold twelve passengers, and
was often used by high-ranking officials and members of senior
command. With no-one having acknowledged her, Estelle slipped back
into her own thoughts and went back over everything that they had
done in the past few weeks at the research facility.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She could not think
where they had gone wrong: her team had been up to scratch on the TAF
simulators; even Dodds, following his lengthy absence from the
cockpit, had performed well. There was no weak link anywhere as far
as she could determine. The ATAF evaluations in the simulators
themselves had gone without a hitch. The team had not lost a single
member during any of the missions they had flown, an act that would
have without doubt been a reason for instant failure. They had not
conceded very many allied casualties during the assessments - in some
cases, none at all; neither had they wasted very much ammunition. All
she could think about was that they had not completed the tasks fast
enough. Stepping into Parks'
office she had been confident that the <I>White
Knights</I> would be charged with piloting the ATAFs
for whatever purpose the Confederation had in mind. But she had
instead seen her dreams go slipping through her fingers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Well, welcome to the
rest of our military lives,” Enrique said, shuffling in his seat,
his arms folded across his chest, his eyes closed. Estelle half
scowled at the back of his chair. The man was just pretending to be
asleep, so as to avoid making conversation with her. It seemed that,
although he too was disappointed, he had been quick to accept it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds had spent the
time before the transport picked them up talking things over with
Estelle and trying to reassure her that, like Parks said, it was not
a reflection on her; although his efforts had done little to persuade
her either way. Chaz had characteristically said nothing to the
others following their meeting with Parks and had instead buried his
head back in his book. No-one had since questioned him about it, a
heavy cloud of rage still lingering over him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“This is your captain
speaking. We are now leaving jump space,” came a pleasant and
cheery voice over the transport's
intercom. From the way she had spoken throughout the journey, Estelle
got the impression that the transport's
captain was used to ferrying VIPs and didn't change the way she
addressed her passengers, regardless of their rank or status.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With their impending
arrival at their destination, Estelle leaned over to take a peak at
Dodds, whose eye were glued to the window he sat beside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:center;">
*

<P CLASS="western">

</P>
<P CLASS="western">
Dodds watched out the
window as the blue haze peeled away and the stars outside came
rushing by. A massive, far-off transport vessel, its engines glowing
with cyan hues, entered the meagre space afforded by his window and
began to slow along with the stars outside. The effect was something
of an illusion: the disengagement from jump space giving the
impression of a rapid burst of speed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds was greeted by a
view of Spirit not long after, the large blue and green ball looming
in his window. As he'd heard a number of times before, the orbital
ring that wrapped its way around the planet was far from complete,
with sections missing here and there. Construction equipment drifted
close by, looking as worn out and neglected as the ring itself. It
appeared that work on the ring had been put on the back burner. As
the planet slid from his view, the captain changing heading to bring
the shuttle in line with their destination, Dodds could not help but
feel that it was a fitting preview of things to come. After the
initial excitement and great anticipation of his call back to duty,
was this really what he had returned to? Maybe his father had been
right all along.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As well as the ring,
Dodds could make out the wheel-like form of the orbital station
hanging high above the planet. It was the first station of its type
that Dodds had ever seen, Xalan's
own orbital station being more saucer-shaped with rounded tops and
bottoms like most others. The design of Spirit's
station looked as though it had wormed its way out of the reject
pile. Either that or it was just cheap.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Kelly, seated in front
of him, turned around with an ominous look on her face, her first
impressions of their destination leaving much to be desired.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Disengagement
complete,” the transport's
captain said as cheery as ever. “Welcome to the Temper system. We
will be entering Spirit's
orbit within the next twenty minutes, before landing at Spirit
Orbital Station and completing our flight. I trust you will have a
pleasant stay.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">

sulking.</P>

<B STYLE="font-size:1.16em;">C</B>ommodore
Parks'
transport shuttle touched down on its appointed cliff-side landing
pad, and the man made his way along a connecting jetty that led
towards a number of tall buildings, set up against a small mountain
range. The buildings that he walked towards were home to a number of
research centres and offices, one of which had been designated to
Admiral Turner for the duration of his stay on Xalan. Though the
admiral had been present on Xalan during the three week ATAF
evaluation program, he had, for various reasons, remained far from
the Obex Research Centre, upon a different continent entirely; the
ground that Parks now trod.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Despite being home to
the Confederation's main
research and development facilities, Xalan was also populated by a
number of thriving cities. Civilian immigration and migration was
rigidly controlled. On a planet such as Xalan, the Confederation were
careful not to allow free movement and risk losing value research and
findings to enemy, or even allied, hands.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Unlike Spirit, Xalan
had no orbital ring, a standard orbital station sufficing. Even so,
the planet was one of the most fortified throughout the Confederacy,
a huge array of long-range planetary defence platforms circling a
vast distance. Many of the platforms were automated and would open
fire on any unidentified object that came into range, after issuing
only a single warning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Turner's
office was high up, affording him a stunning panorama of the city. It
was early evening when Parks arrived and the many lights from
buildings and low flying vehicles could be seen twinkling in the
fading light. Occasional patrol craft passed by his office window.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Good evening,
Commodore,” Turner said as Parks was shown in by the admiral's
security.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Good evening,
Admiral,” Parks responded, saluting.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Please leave us,”
Turner looked to the security personnel who stood either side of the
door inside his office. The pair saluted and left.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Don't
concern yourself with any standards of correctness, Commodore, I
don't expect this to be a
formal meeting,” Turner said once the door had shut. “Let me
apologise for having you run around so much these past few days. I
appreciate that the constant back and forth can be stressful and I
myself find space travel so much more convenient. No need to worry
about things like atmospherics.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That's quite all
right, sir,” Parks said. “Whatever was needed to get the job
done.” Parks had indeed been travelling a lot recently. Whilst in
the Indigo system he had divided his duties between Xalan's
many research centres and the orbital station, spending a fair amount
of time being transported between all of them. The constant travel
had begun to take its toll, but he was coping.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Spectacular, isn't
it?” Turner changed the subject, nodding to the view out of the
window.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I was about to say
so myself,” Parks agreed, looking out at the bright lights of the
city in the distance. “How do they manage to get any work done here
with a view like that?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That's
part of the reason we move most of them underground!” Turner
chuckled. “Drink?” The admiral walked over to a cabinet and
removed two spirit glasses. He picked up a near full decanter of
whiskey and gave it a gentle shake, with a smile. “Imperial White
Label.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“How did you get
that?” Parks asked, knowing that the contents of the vessel the
admiral held were not only very expensive, but also difficult to get
hold of.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The admiral smiled,
pouring out a modest amount of the amber liquid into each glass. “It
was confiscated from one of the local residents returning home. I saw
it on the seizures list and decided to help myself. One signature and
it was mine.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks raised an eyebrow
at just how blasé the admiral was acting. Never in his career had he
seen the man behave in such a manner.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Anything else?”
Parks asked as Turner dropped a couple of ice cubes into each glass.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No,” Turner waved
a hand dismissively. “A man of my authority shouldn't abuse his
position. So, knowing that, I just took the other two bottles.” The
admiral smirked and handed one of the glasses to Parks. He then
returned to his desk, sinking down into the comfortable black leather
chair with a contented sigh. He then raised his glass.
“Congratulations on a job well done, Commodore,” he said, before
knocking back some of the liquor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Thank you, sir.”
Parks took a small sip of the whiskey, never too sure if he would
ever acquire a taste for it. The Imperials tended to like their drink
strong, vodka being high on their list of exports. The spirit was
drunk in vast quantities by asteroid and mineral miners all over the
galaxy, the most popular being a brand known as Velda; coincidently
made by the same company that produced the White Label whiskey. Parks
had tried some on occasion and found it to be, in his own words,
“lethal”. At close to one hundred and fifty proof it was not a
drink to be taken lightly. It was also quite flammable and, as a
consequence, banned in many bars throughout the Confederacy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Looks like we got
our men then. Or, in this case, women,” Turner said cheerily. He
rocked the whiskey glass in his hand, staring at the liquid within
and watching the way it washed over and around the ice cubes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks said nothing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You don't
agree?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“With all due
respect, sir, I feel the <I>Knights</I>
would have been a better choice.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Don't
take it personally, Elliott, this isn't
a competition,” Turner said with a small air of impatience. “You
have to remember that at the end of the day we may in fact be doing
them a <I>favour</I>.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“There was very
little in it,” Parks objected.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“In the <I>test
scores</I>, yes. But I have doubts about their psychological
profiles, Commodore and <I>that</I>
is what will count. We only have nine months or so to convince those
five women of the truly monumental task that we will be expecting
them to undertake. For now, we may as well take the opportunity to
celebrate one thing going right over the last six months. God knows
we could use it with the prospect of never seeing <I>Dragon</I>
again. I'd sooner have that
battleship completely destroyed than in the hands of the Enemy.”
The last part became something of an irritated mumble. He took
another drink from his glass, leaned back in his chair and looked up
at the ceiling.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks, tired of
standing, sat down in a chair adjacent to the admiral's
desk. He recalled going over the results of the ATAF evaluation test
scores and seeing the minimal differences between the <I>Red
Devils</I> and <I>White
Knights</I>. There were various aspects of the
evaluation where the two teams had out-performed one another, leading
to a very difficult decision. In the end, however, the <I>Red
Devils</I> had just edged out the <I>White
Knights</I>, leaving Parks with the painful task of
reassigning the team to the border. The <I>Silver
Panthers</I> had performed to a far lesser degree when
compared to the others and Parks had returned them to their previous
duties.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What happens if the
<I>Devils</I>
refuse to go through with it?” Parks asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That's
why we need to be absolutely sure that they won't,
Elliott,” Turner said in a gruff voice. “We cannot afford to have
them pull another Patrick Dean on us. That little incident set us
back well over a month.” He paused, staring into space, then said,
“remind me: what was the official line on that incident?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That all members of
the <I>Yellow
Dogs</I> were killed during covert operations. There
were no bodies to recover because they were all vaporised in
starfighter explosions,” Parks recited.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That's
not a story we can spin out for another five pilots if they also
decide to run,” Turner said. “I don't
like the idea of keeping secrets from our own men, but if it means
the difference between keeping the facts away from the general public
and chaos on a quite literally galactic scale, then so be it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“And if the <I>Devils</I>
do try to run?” Parks wanted to know.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Then we will have to
find another way,” Turner said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
But both Turner and
Parks knew that there was no real other way and the tone of Turner's
voice had already acknowledged that fact. In order for the ATAF
project to successfully run its course from here on out, there could
be very little room for deviation or stalling, meaning that both men
would have to be dead certain of their every decision. But neither of
them wanted to talk about it now, Parks himself figuring there would
be plenty of time in the coming months. He decided to change the
subject.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I received word that
the <I>Knights</I>
arrived at Spirit early this afternoon, local time. They will begin
routine patrols and counter piracy measures within the next few
days.” He decided not to bother Turner with the details of the
little incident with Chaz at the time he had informed the group of
their new duty. He was sure that it would not have surprised the
admiral in the slightest. It could be put into a report for his
perusal at a later date.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Under Aiden and
Anthony?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Just Captain Meyers,
but the commodore will also be around as needed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Turner nodded. “They
will be in good hands with Aiden. He's
a good man, if a bit soft. He seems to prefer the carrot to the stick
nine times out of ten, which may be the reason he's passed over for
promotion so often.” Turner drained his glass. “And the <I>Red
Devils</I>?” He poured himself another small measure
of whiskey.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks declined the
offer of a top up, but noticed that Turner eyed him closely, as if
suggesting the drink were needed. “The <I>Red
Devils</I> will begin hands-on ATAF training operations
in the pre-arranged location against some holographic units. After
that, they will participate in simulated combat training against real
pilots.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Just so long as they
don't kill anyone,” Turner
remarked. “I don't expect
those other pilots quite know what they're
in for, facing off against those fighters. They're
in for one hell of a shock.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Turner drank again from
his glass and Parks looked down into what remained of his own
whiskey. He had decided that he really was not very fond of it and in
future he would only drink it out of good grace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Turner cleared his
throat and set his glass down on the table. “Now, Elliott, I have
to confess I didn't just ask
you here to share a celebratory glass of whiskey. You may be aware
that I have been in the service of the CSN for most of my life,
something the suits in Office have come to realise, too. So, it is
with some regret that I have to inform you that in just over six
weeks' time I will be
retiring from service.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>What?</I>”
Parks almost dropped his glass in shock.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I know you believed
that I was going to be around until the very end, but that hasn't
been the case for quite sometime. Sorry for the deception.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks was stunned.
Everything now seemed quite urgent and the situation he found himself
in threatened to overwhelm him. He pulled back his sleeve to look at
his watch. He had lost all sense of time and was wishing that six
weeks meant six months.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“But... sir, that's
impossible... it's... surely
it's a mistake?” Parks
spluttered as he fought to control the mild terror that was rising
within him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Over the past few years
Parks and Turner had worked very close together to ensure that the
ATAF project would run smoothly. In the grand scheme of things they
hadn't even completed the first phase of the project, the most
important aspects were yet to come. Parks now felt it all to be for
naught as the admiral passed all future responsibility on him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Out of the window
before him, Parks found that the darkening skies, and layers and
layers of thick grey clouds, seemed very poignant at that precise
moment in time. The man felt as though he had been left holding the
baby, leaving him without any means of support or food, and bleak
future prospects.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm
sorry, Elliott, and I wish there was more that I could do, but
unfortunately my retirement has been forced upon me,” the old
admiral said in regretful tones. “I have already deferred it by
more than two years, so I am unable to play that card.” He rose
from his chair and paced slowly back and forth in front of the
window, looking again out at the beautiful cityscape. “The suits
want me out. They're afraid
that a man of my age will start to make mistakes and could then
jeopardise the project. Ha! I may be old, but I'm
not senile just yet. Whiskey?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks became aware of
the admiral hovering over him. He had disappeared into his own
thoughts as he had attempted to digest the news that had hit him like
a sledgehammer. He only nodded, seeing the whiskey as a buffer and
immediate comforter. Turner topped up his glass.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What's
going to happen?” Parks asked after taking a good drink.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You're
going to finish what we started, Commodore. You're
not going to give up or wind things down a notch just because I'm no
longer able to participate in the project. What would you do if, for
example, I were killed while in transit?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The point was well
made. Parks reflected that people often forgot that responsibility
was often passed to them without fair warning. He would be able to
make use of Turner's
knowledge for the next six weeks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We still have until
the end of June, Elliott,” Turner added. “There is plenty of time
to ensure the transition. You know most of it anyway.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks studied Turner as
he spoke and for the first time he became aware that the admiral
looked old and tired. His eyes betrayed a sense of weariness unusual
in such a strong minded man. But with the revelation of his impending
retirement his other features, the greyed and thinned hair, his thin
face and wrinkles, no longer said “experienced”.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Everything is
changing, Elliott,” Turner said, a touch sadly. “We're
becoming more and more like a federation every day. Current events
are forcing us all to work much closer together than ever before and
the government is only getting stronger for it. We're
more tightly coupled now than at any time in the last century.” He
was sitting once more in his chair and was leaning back, staring up
at the ceiling again. Parks studied him as he did so, trying to see
into his mind, to hear what the man might be thinking. “And whether
the independent nations like it or not, with the gradual unifications
of their governments and military forces they're making steps towards
becoming a confederate state. Whether or not any of these things are
good, only time will tell. Whatever happens, the galaxy will be a
very different place in the next five or six years.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The two men sat in
silence for a time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Do you have any
plans? For your retirement, I mean?” Parks asked. He was not very
good at small talk, but felt that it could only serve to calm them
both.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Actually, yes!”
Turner sat forward and smiled, now quite jubilant. “I'll be
returning to Earth to see my new granddaughter. You may remember that
my daughter was supposedly barren? As it happens she gave birth to a
naturally conceived healthy young girl a few days ago, and I plan on
being there with my family.” He took another drink; he was close to
finishing his second glass. “To tell the truth I'll be grateful to
spend as much time with them as possible. Should none of this work
out in the end then I will prefer to have spent the time left with my
family, rather than in some stellar graveyard. I hope you do not
think that cowardly of me?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, sir.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Good. Despite our
duties some of us did find time to start a family,” Turner
muttered, looking into the bottom of his glass as he spoke.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Some of us just
don't seem to be able to get
started,” Parks muttered back. For all his time in the Navy, Parks
had never found time for romance or relationships and he knew Turner
could tell that he had all but given up, more important things now
driving him onwards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Strength to carry
on, Commodore. We're only
human after all.” Turner set his glass down on the desk, having
drained it. “Admiral Jenkins will be taking over my duties
following my departure. She is already aware of my situation and the
status of the project. I suggest that before the end of the month the
three of us take some time to get together and become more familiar
with each other's core
responsibilities and assignments. That should help to ensure that
there are no shocks in store come the beginning of July. Until that
time I will continue to retain full command over the CSN.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks nodded an
acknowledgement, taking another sip of whiskey.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Now, I expect you
have a lot to think about and do, so I will not take up any more of
your time,” Turner said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks rose and saluted,
taking the hint. “Thank you for the drink, sir.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Funny how a bit of
bad news can take away the taste of bad whiskey,” Turner chuckled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks was under the
impression that he had hidden his revulsion well. He made a mental
note never to play poker against the admiral.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Turner, too, stood and
saluted. “Safe journey. I have the utmost faith in you to see this
through, Elliott. Remember that.”</P>

Returning to his
transport, Parks paused to take in the view once more. The high
landing jetty provided a view of almost equal beauty to that of
Turner's office. There he
stood for a while at the cliff edge, feeling the cool breeze of the
evening wind upon his hands and face, looking out at the cityscape
and the light reflecting off twin moons, shimmering across the gentle
waves of the calm ocean all about it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He had seen more
stunning sights during his lifetime, but tonight, at that particular
moment, this was at the same time the most beautiful and most
frightening sight he had ever seen: for it was a testament to the
power of the human spirit, from their humble beginnings on Earth to a
spacefaring race, spanning dozens of star systems across the galaxy;
and with that a stark reminder of the penalty for failure.</P>

<P CLASS="western">
After many hours in
flight, the Knights' transport at last docked with Spirit Orbital and
the ever-chipper voice of the transport's
captain informed the pilots that it was safe for them to disembark.
There were grumbles from Estelle as they stepped out onto the flight
deck, the initial impressions of the station itself no less than what
any of them had expected. From the moment he stepped out of the
transport Dodds at once noticed that the station presented an air of
being run down, neglected and somehow trapped in the past.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>White
Knights</I>?” a deck attendant enquired. Estelle
begrudgingly confirmed their identity. “Follow me. There is a
shuttle waiting to take you down to the surface.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds started after the
man with the others, catching the sound of chuckling as he did so. He
looked around to see a group of service men and women, engineers and
various other deckhands watched as he traipsed by, heads turning and
grinning to one another. Dodds figured that the <I>Knights</I>
were far from the first to feel somewhat repulsed by their new
surroundings, and it must have been a great source of amusement for
the current residents to see the reactions each time a new set of
faces turned up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Reaching the shuttle,
Dodds slung his meagre bag of possessions inside before slumping down
onto one of the steel benches that ran the length of the cramped
interior. Though he tried to remain upbeat, something about his new
surroundings was already attempting to break his spirit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:center;">

<P CLASS="western">

</P>
<P CLASS="western">
Touching down on the
planet's surface, Dodds
needed no further confirmation that their special treatment was well
and truly over. Arriving at their mixed quarters, he and Enrique were
dismayed to find they were crammed in with fifteen others. Their
appearance at the doorway was greeted by cheers and whistles from
their new bunk mates.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hey! It's the new
guys!” came a cry from across the quarters.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We've got ourselves
a full house, boys!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Welcome to Action
Central!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hey, you! Think
fast!” A ball was thrown towards Dodds. He fumbled the catch,
letting it roll out of his hands and bounce around on the floor for a
time, before its path was halted by the clutter it encountered there.
It looked as though the base - or at least these quarters - was not
big on discipline, with clothes and personal belongs scattered all
about. It looked like a holiday camp for rowdy teenagers. Kelly poked
her head between Enrique and Dodds, who had halted in the doorway.
Estelle squeezed past all three and scanned the room.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“oh dear god,”
Kelly said in a low voice. “I really wish I was back at Gabriel.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Uh huh,” Enrique
answered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Please sleep next to
me,” Kelly said to Enrique. Dodds noted that the men in the
dormitory were already eyeing up the two women, and were being
anything but subtle about it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Wouldn't
want it any other way,” Enrique said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds was in agreement.
After three weeks of his own personal space, and five months back
home before that, this new regime was going to take a lot of getting
used to.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle coped a lot
better, striding in, finding a spare bed and claiming it for her own,
tossing the random items that occupied it onto another nearby bed. In
the hours that followed it did not take her long to discover that she
was the highest ranking officer in the dormitory (something that
genuinely astonished her) and as a consequence one of the least
popular.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
At another time, in
another place,
Dodds would have advised her against flexing her muscles in the very
first instance, but right now he was not in the mood.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz found himself a
bunk, acting as always with his trademark silence. With his locker
filled with clothes, boots and other personnel effects the man kicked
back, pulled out his book and disappeared into the pages.</P>

“Welcome to Mandelah
Naval Base, boy and girls; and welcome to Spirit. I'm Captain Meyers
and while here you will be acting under my command,” the portly,
ginger bearded man said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The <I>White
Knights</I> were seated within a small briefing room,
alongside other new arrivals to the Temper system, some of whom
shared their new quarters.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The group had been
given a brief tour of the base and found that, even though Spirit had
an orbital station, the overpopulation of available pilots meant that
many of them had to be based on the ground. It also meant that in
order to perform their duties, they would have to be transferred back
up to the orbital station on an almost daily basis.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
This would not have
been the case if construction on the orbital ring had been completed,
allowing for crew, service personnel and starfighters to be housed
within, Estelle grumbled during the tour. As it stood, not even the
craft that they would be required to pilot were stationed
planet-side. Standard Confederation starfighters were not capable of
withstanding the stresses that atmospheres would put upon them whilst
attempting planetary leave or re-entry. All this, Estelle had also
reminded them, slipping into a sulk, was not something that the ATAF
suffered from. Dodds caught Chaz's
eye and swore later he saw him crack a smile. For his moody exterior
he was starting to find some mirth in Estelle's
continued moaning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds suppressed a
small sigh, folded his arms and tried to appear interested in what
Meyers was saying. The captain was giving them an overview of what
would be expected of them whilst they were stationed at Spirit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“The Temper system is
the principle route, and therefore the closest Confederation border
world, to Independent World space,” Meyers went on. “In general
terms this means that all sane traffic wishing to safely enter or
leave Confederation-controlled space must do so via this system.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Why?” a female
voice behind Dodds asked. He didn't bother to look around to see who
was asking the question. “I mean, we can easily travel all the way
from Earth to Kethlan in a single jump if we wanted to.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Not any longer, no,”
Meyers said. “Owing to recent developments within the Mitikas
Imperium, the Confederation is no longer permitting jumpgates, save
for those along the border, to allow incoming or outgoing traffic to
non-Confederate destinations.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“So everyone is
having to come through here instead?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“For the foreseeable
future, yes.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“But the volume of
traffic must be incredible!” the voice sounded quite taken aback.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It is, yes, but it's
a necessary precaution that the government wishes to take.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds had the image of
an egg timer in his head, the grains of sand being the starships that
were waiting - with strained tempers - to pass through the gates and
move on to their destination.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“But what about
everyone else? If they have their own jump drives they don't need to
use the gates. Somewhere between ten and fifteen percent of all
spacecraft can form their own jump points.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds met Enrique's
eyes and raised an eyebrow at the comment from the well versed
informant.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Meyers put up his hand
and waved the woman down. “We'll get on to how we are tackling that
in a little bit. For now, all of the Confederacy's navigation buoys
are refusing to supply data on routes towards non-Confederate systems
and, in particular, the Mitikas Empire. Without that data, space is
once again as the sea was to early sailors on Earth: a treacherous
place with little to no landmarks.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Until they learned
to use the stars to navigate,” another voice chipped in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“True,” Meyers
began to chuckle. “But you'd have a hell of a time doing that up
there.” He nodded towards the ceiling. “Now...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Excuse me, Captain,
but what are the government taking precautions against?” yet
another voice piped up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Mass immigration,”
Meyers said simply. “The increased instability of the Imperial
systems has led to a greater amount of traffic coming into Temper,
and from there into further sectors of Confederation space. Most of
these are traders attempting to find new avenues of business now that
their old ones have closed. Unfortunately, organised crime is also
suffering the same loss and you can bet that they will also come
flooding in with them. Now...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sir?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds found that Meyers
was proving to be incredibly patient, given the continued
interruptions. He'd heard that the man was like that though: very
pleasant and accommodating; and that was also why he was still a
captain and not a commodore. Heads turned around, following Meyers'
eyes. Dodds looked about this time, seeing an olive-skinned man with
a puzzled expression holding his hand in the air. For a moment Dodds
thought he recognised him as one of the five men from the lecture
theatre all those weeks ago, but realised he was mistaken. Meyers
scratched at his beard as the man spoke.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm sorry, Captain,
but this sounds like a job for the local police, not the Navy.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“True, but the police
forces throughout Temper have come under increased stress whilst
attempting to handle this issue and have requested our assistance.
You should be aware that it could also soon no longer be a matter for
the police; remember that this is also a game of politics: whilst
relationships are now good with previously troublesome Independent
World systems, a show of strength is no bad thing.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sounds like they're
turning us into the flood barriers,” Dodds heard Enrique whisper to
Kelly. He noticed Kelly appear to snap awake, as if she had been
daydreaming. He could relate: he was drifting in and out of the room
himself, trying to think of a way he could escape to somewhere more
interesting and not involving apples.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“So we're
going to be making pre-emptive strikes against known pirate bases and
insurgent strongholds?” the questioner asked, his face brightening
at the prospect for some action. At the man's
words the assembled pilots all became much more awake and alert.
Dodds imagined that they, like him, were visualising scenarios in
which they were performing important and heroic services to the
Confederation, none of which went unnoticed, and all of which
resulted in a great deal of action, grand recognition, and
well-deserved promotion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Not at this point,
no,” Meyers said, almost as if he was apologising. “For the
foreseeable future you will all be assigned regular patrols within
the Temper system.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Oh dear God, please
just kill me now,” Enrique said under his breath and slid down in
his seat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Make that a double,”
Dodds requested, his own dreams of valour vanishing before his eyes.
It was as if some twenty four hours previous he had been quaffing the
highest quality Dom Pérignon, but was now being force-fed cheap
plonk. Estelle, seated in front of the pair, turned around and shot
them an angry glare that said, “Sit Up, Shut up and Put Up”.
Enrique and Dodds pulled themselves both upright and attempted to
stay focused.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Meyers, with the aid of
a map of the Temper system, went on to list patrol routes, potential
trouble hotspots, (<I>Yeah,
right</I>, Dodds thought to himself) and schedules.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>White
Knights</I>?” Meyers asked as he ended the briefing
with the flight roster.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“First Lieutenant
Estelle de Winter, <I>White
Knights</I>,” Estelle said, standing up and saluting.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I wonder where she
learned that one?” Dodds muttered sarcastically to Enrique,
lowering his voice a lot more this time so as not to enrage his
superior.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Lieutenant, you will
be performing your first patrol tomorrow afternoon at fourteen
hundred hours. All route information will be provided to you on
Spirit Orbital before the start of your patrol. You and your team
should be ready one hour prior to commencement for transfer to orbit.
So, thirteen hundred hours at landing zone D.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That is all boys and
girls. Please ensure you check the flight roster regularly, as it
will change. Dismissed.”</P>

<I>I have to confess
that I am actually enjoying my posting to Spirit a lot more than I
first thought I would. When we were initially transferred here I
thought it would prompt the end to my time in the Navy and I would
hand in my resignation. I'm
glad that I didn't as I
would only have been disappointed with myself upon returning home. I
haven't been in contact with
my family for a few weeks now, not since arriving. But I don't
expect they will be concerned.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>When I first arrived
here it was like my first day in the service all over again. That's
what too much pampering will do to you, I guess. I figured that
Spirit would be a dull, lifeless rock with nothing to keep me sane
between the endless patrols. As a matter of fact there is quite a lot
to do here and I've taken up running and some other activities with
Enrique and Dodds. The planet is quite temperate, not as hot here as
I would like (shouldn't
expect it to get any hotter than 22c, I'm
told) but it could be far worse.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>We get most of our
evenings free here, though not the weekends any more. The schedule of
the patrols means that our days off vary, but we usually don't
have to do more than five days on the trot. We don't
have to patrol at night either because those stationed on the orbital
handle that, although some of our patrols do end rather late and then
we might have an early one the next morning. Today I've
got another day off after four days of patrolling. There are a few
towns nearby, but I couldn't
be bothered to head into any of them. I felt like just unwinding and
doing a bit of a work on my journal, so I went for a walk instead.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>I've
never been stationed on a planet that had an orbital ring before, at
least, if I was, I don't
remember being so. It's only
half finished, but it is quite a beautiful and surreal sight. On
clear days you can make out the ring from the ground, high in the
sky. It's in a geostationary
orbit, so it's pretty much
the same thing every time, but it's
still amazing to look at. Night times are spectacular, with portions
of the ring lit up in the sky. I expect that once it is finished then
it'll be even more so
(although that's probably
wishful thinking since I'm
told it probably won't be
for quite sometime).</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>Chaz seems to have
come out of his shell a bit. They have a number of boxing and other
martial art type classes here, so he and Enrique often go there
together to practice. I'm
not sure if there is much left for Enrique to learn, but he tells me
that Chaz is helping him to hone some of his skills, so I guess
there's a lot more to it.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>He's still a touch
grumpy though and doesn't have a lot to say, so you could probably
imagine my surprise when he came over and spoke to me. I
was sitting on my bed writing and he asked me if I wanted to go for a
run with him. He hardly said a word to me while we were jogging, but
we held a good pace together and he slowed when I needed to (I really
need to work on my stamina). We spoke briefly afterwards, but it was
mainly about the run. I decided not to talk about anything else
though, didn't
want to burn any bridges. We're
still not sure what got him so upset with Commodore Parks. I saw that
he got another one of his video disks a couple of days ago. He also
received one when we were stationed at Xalan, but became really
defensive when we asked him about it. I'm
intrigued as to what's
on them, but we've
decided it's
best not to ask him about it, just in case he stops talking to us
again.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>I do feel sorry for
Estelle though. We might be enjoying ourselves here more than we
expected to, but Estelle sees herself as being stuck in a rut. I
think she put in a request for a transfer, but it was denied. I hate
to sound selfish, but I'm
glad. She's one of my
dearest friends and I would hate to see her go. I can sort of
understand what she's going
through though. She really had her heart set on things back at Xalan
and the transfer here (especially given Spirit's
reputation) must have nearly killed her inside.</I></P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Kelly?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The word drifted
through Kelly Taylor's head
as she continued to work, failing to registering. It being her day
off she had spent most of the day writing, the stylus strokes of her
normal handwriting being transformed into characters on the screen.
Just now something had broken her concentration and she struck
through the word she had written to erase it, trying to regain her
train of thought.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Kelly? Hey!” an
impatient voice called out, making the young woman jump. Kelly looked
up from where she sat, cross legged on her bed, to see that Estelle
had been demanding her attention.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sorry, Estelle, what
did you say?” Kelly asked. She then noticed that Estelle was
wearing her flight suit and felt a small twinge of panic in the pit
her of stomach.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I said hurry the
hell up because you're going
to make us late for our patrol! Our transport is waiting to go!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I... I thought we
had the day off?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, that's
tomorrow! They changed the schedule this morning! Come on Kelly,
you've only got a couple of
minutes to suit up! We've
got to get to landing zone G and that's
not exactly next door!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Kelly swore as she
jumped off her bed and hurriedly began packing up her belongings. She
cursed herself for being so busy that day reviewing her journal,
correcting spelling and reading through past entries that she had
neglected to check the patrol schedule. She tugged open her locker,
pulling out her flight suit and boots, tearing off her clothes and
throwing them to the floor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She struggled to get
into her flight suit as fast as possible, managing to get one leg in
and then starting on the next. The flight suits were skin tight and
did not slip on very easily; it was like trying to put on a
wetsuit...</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Stop bloody staring,
you perv!” Estelle's voice came. Kelly followed Estelle's icy glare
to a man who had been reclining on his bed opposite, reading a book.
He had since lowered it to take a look at Kelly as she stood in her
underwear, but with Estelle glaring at him, he was once again
returning to his reading material. Kelly saw Estelle turn back to her
once more, her eyes still narrowed, and quickly turned away to
concentrate on getting ready. She didn't want to hear any accusations
roll off Estelle's tongue right now, she was more than capable of
imagining what they might be, having heard them on occasions before:
wondering how Kelly could be such a good pilot and yet so absent
minded at other times, spending too much time scribbling in her
journal when there were more important things - such as this - that
she needed to pay attention to, and questioning why she kept a
journal at all; no good would ever come from all the constant
writing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Thankfully, Kelly was
just about done.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Do the rest on the
way,” Estelle suggested whilst Kelly's
fingers attended to the various clips on her boots. Her boots more or
less fastened, Kelly picked up her personal belonging and threw them
in her locker before securing it. Although she got on well with the
others in their shared quarters, she did not know any of them well
enough yet to trust them. She had also written little comments about
each of them in her journal that she thought they'd
be better off not seeing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Okay, ready.”
Kelly said, turning back to Estelle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Kelly, where's
your helmet?” Estelle said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Kelly looked at the
floor, then her bed and realised that she'd
left it inside the locker. She yanked it out and then secured the
locker once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>Ready</I>?”
Estelle asked once Kelly finally appeared to be done. She did not
wait for an answer before indicating that they had wasted enough time
already.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Where are the
others?” Kelly asked, as the pair hastened down the various well
lit corridors, dodging other inhabitants of the base as they sort to
ensure they made it to the transport in time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“They're
there already. I came back to find you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sorry.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Just don't
make a habit of it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
They stepped out of the
barracks, into the open air, where they stepped up their pace in
order to reach the assigned pick-up point. The shuttle craft awaited
their arrival, but Kelly could see the air around the engines
shimmering, indicating that it was prepared to set off the moment the
two women were aboard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
An air marshal stood by
the side door watched their approach. “de Winter? Taylor?” he
asked the pair as they arrived at the transport.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
They nodded, somewhat
out of breath.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Good. Get inside. We
almost had to go without you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The door shut and
bolted behind them and they sat down on one of the two steel benches
running either side of the length of the craft.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hey,” Kelly said
to the rest of her team, once she managed to get her breath back. The
shuttle was full today, all thirty places taken up. Kelly reached up
and pulled the restraining harness down around her. The transport was
far less glamorous than the one they had used when they had been
ferried to and from Xalan, being a lot more cramped and uncomfortable
with no view of the outside world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Journal?” Enrique,
whom she had sat next to, whispered in her ear. She gave a sheepish
nod in reply. It wasn't the first time - and unlikely to be the last
- that her hobby had almost landed her in serious trouble.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Prepare for
takeoff,” the transport's
pilot called back at them. The craft shuddered as the engines engaged
and Kelly felt them leave the ground. The shuddering increased as the
transport lifted them into orbit. She always hated this part. Even
after several weeks of having to endure it, it still did not get any
better. Around her others had a tight hold of their restraining bars,
some with their eyes closed. She joined in. The journey to the
orbital station was not long, and a short time later the restraining
bars were disengaged.</P>

“Today you will be
patrolling route Delta D-15,” the Officer of the Deck said as he
handed Estelle an electronic map of the route around the Temper
system. “You should ensure that you hit all four check points at
least once an hour.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds stole a glance
over Estelle's shoulder at
the route map to see if there was anything interesting on their
patrol that day; even a minute piece of information that might make
the next four hours a bit more bearable. There was nothing. For Dodds
the patrols were now becoming a chore; a regular job that he dreaded
going to each morning and which did nothing except take up his free
time. He desperately wanted something to happen to break the monotony
of the hours he spent in the cockpit. He had twice had to endure just
over six hours in the seat, doing nothing but watching a jumpgate and
its uninteresting traffic flow, with little more than an hour's
break. It was just as he had feared after Meyers' briefing all those
weeks ago and he had been mentally and physically exhausted after
both of those. It was like being tortured to death.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The flight deck of the
orbital station was never silent. Starfighters were for ever being
returned to their bays or taxiing to the catapult, preparing for
launch. Engineers and technicians were working to repair wear and
tear, as well as performing general maintenance. Munitions handlers
were moving heavy-laden trolleys around the deck, so that they could
be loaded onto fighters.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
A number of different
craft occupied the bays here, the TAF being the most common. Next
there was the two-seater Ray. Though the fighter was less nimble than
the TAF, it benefited from greater defensive and offensive
capabilities. On their patrols Chaz and Enrique would usually fly one
together, availability allowing. Otherwise their flight group
consisted exclusively of TAFs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Several Rooks occupied
other bays, though none of them had moved in all the weeks that Dodds
had been stationed at Spirit, the fighters'
main purpose said to be the defence of the station itself. The Rooks
were almost never allocated to patrols, the easier to maintain TAFs
and Rays being given that duty. Dodds was not fond of the Rook
himself, the craft feeling far too bulky and sluggish in flight. It
felt even worse in combat, where lighter and faster starfighters
could outmanoeuvre it. Even so he had, at one time, looked upon the
Rook in awe; there had been no denying it was a powerful craft. He
now gave them little more than a sideways glance, aware that the
crown belonged to another.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hot out there
today?” Enrique said, as Dodds and Estelle continued to study the
route map.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Been all quiet so
far, sir,” the officer replied.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The response did not
surprise Dodds. <I>Should have
applied for that damn transfer</I>, he thought. Though after
Estelle had been denied her own request to seek adventure and
excitement elsewhere - actually, in her case, recognition - he was
pretty certain he knew what the answer to his would be: remain at
Spirit until further notice. He was just going to have to lump it for
the time being; he was not about to return to Earth with his tail
between his legs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Around Dodds others
were finishing their patrols. He watched with envy as the
appreciative pilots removed their helmets and left the flight deck to
return to their quarters for a well-earned hot shower. He looked
forward to being in their position later on. At least today's
patrol was only three hours long.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He watched as Estelle
clicked through the map a few times, scrutinizing each segment before
handing it back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Thank you,” she
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Everything good?”
the flight officer asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yep.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>No</I>,
thought Dodds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Okay, we'll see you
back here at twenty hundred hours,” the flight officer replied,
before heading off.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>Only if I
don't
die of boredom in the cockpit first.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Right, Kelly, I want
you out there first,” Estelle said. “Takeoff and then hold
position outside the orbital until we are all assembled. Got it?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, Lieutenant,”
Kelly said, shuffling off towards her waiting TAF.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Best to make sure
that she's actually with us and not bumbling about some place else,”
Estelle muttered to the three men stood on the deck next to her. The
four watched as Kelly's TAF accelerated down the catapult.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Who's acting wing
commander for this patrol?” Dodds said, as Estelle began to make
for her allocated TAF.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I am, Dodds,”
Estelle answered with a flat, tired voice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>What
a surprise</I>, Dodds thought gloomily. On a patrol it was
hardly a significant duty, but one that might help to lift his
spirits a little. He thought of the irony of the name of the planet
he was based. <I>Two hundred and
thirty five minutes to go. Two hundred and thirty if I'm </I>really<I>
lucky</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
An attendant signalled
to Dodds that his TAF was ready and the young pilot traipsed his way
over to the starfighter. One day of proper action was all that he
wished for as he stepped up into the TAF's
seat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He secured his helmet,
buckled himself in and then gave a thumbs-up to Enrique and Chaz,
standing down on the flight deck, watching him. The two men were
waiting for the all-clear to board the Ray they had been assigned for
the patrol. Enrique gave Dodds a thumbs-up in return. Chaz gave him
an almost invisible nod, Dodds only catching it because of knowing
what to expect of the man.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With his TAF taxied up
to the catapult Dodds waited to be granted clearance to launch.
Staring down the illuminated tunnel, to the dark space outside, Dodds
tried to gear himself for the next few <I>thrilling</I>
hours ahead. He now understood why Temper was often referred to as
“Action Central”.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Lieutenant Dodds,
this is Tower: you're clear
for takeoff,” a woman's
voice came over his cockpit's
intercom.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah thanks, Tower,”
Dodds replied. “I'll be
sure to let you know if anything interesting happens; like we come
across <I>Dragon</I>,
hidden under a load of black tarpaulin.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>Please,
just remind me I</I><I>'</I><I>m
alive</I>, he begged, as his TAF hurtled down the
catapult and out the station. <I>At
least for just one day.</I></P>

“He's
coming back around!” Dodds cried, as the fighter he had been
tailing barrelled and then circled around over his head. Dodds dipped
his TAF out of the way before rolling around to continue his pursuit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm
on him,” Kelly called, bringing the craft into her sights. She
adjusted her speed to hold it there for as long as possible, so as to
give her on-board computer time to lock a missile. Her opponent's
movements were all over the place, swerving this way and that, Kelly
herself doing her best to counter its erratic nature. She had only to
keep the craft within her HUD for a few moments longer and then the
missile would be ready to fire... The fighter accelerated away
suddenly, shaking her off and diving straight down towards Enrique
and Chaz who were already tailing another of the group's opponents.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The <I>White
Knights</I> had been halfway through their patrol when
they were alerted to a set of unidentified vessels travelling through
their assigned route. Speeding into the vicinity they had sighted
their quarry, the three craft bunched up close together and appearing
to be in a hurry. Their trajectory put them on course with a jumpgate
that would take them deeper into Confederation-controlled space, and
the speed and formation of the craft suggested that they were trying
to pass through undetected.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle's
requests for identification, destination and business purpose had
been ignored, the three fighters maintaining their tight formation,
but increasing their speed. Estelle had challenged them twice more
before the craft had turned hostile. Based on their vessel of choice
– a Dart, a cheap single seat, general purpose craft with
innumerable available variants - she had concluded that they must be
wanted criminals. She had gone on to order them to surrender several
times before Dodds reminded her that it did not seem like they were
the talkative type.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Kelly's eyes narrowed.
Though the Dart that was once again in her sights benefited from
upgraded offensive and defensive capabilities, she maintained that
the only real advantage the long-bodied craft held over her TAF was
its speed. Her on-board computer jingled and she loosed the missile
even before the lock verification had time to flash across her HUD.
It sped away from her, trailing blue and white particles as it
twisted and curled to keep up with its target's frantic attempts to
evade it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>That
makes up for being tardy, I suppose</I>, Kelly thought
to herself as the Dart exploded before her in a shower of debris.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Target down,” she
reported.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Good work, Kelly,”
Estelle came back. “One down, two to go.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Got one right behind
me,” Dodds said, feeling his TAF vibrate as particle bolts slammed
into the rear, the shielding absorbing the hits.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle made a quick
assessment of the situation and standings. The death of their comrade
had had a detrimental effect on the performance of the two remaining
Dart flyers, whose flight had become far more sloppy, their
confidence shaken.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Enrique, Chaz, stay
on your target; Kelly you assist them. Dodds, help me with the other
one.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Got it,” Dodds
confirmed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The four Confederation
fighters divided as Estelle had ordered and set after their targets.
The Darts weaved and dived as the <I>Knights</I>
tailed them, frequently coming close to collisions with their
pursuers as they made snap changes to their headings. Plasma and
particle rounds flew in every direction as the two sides attempted to
bring one another down, none quite managing to hit home.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Damn this crap HUD!”
Dodds said as the Dart evaded another burst of his guns. After three
weeks of benefiting from the ATAF's
predictive targeting capabilities he now felt crippled without it, as
though he was handcuffed to his seat. It was clear that the
advantages the starfighter offered had spoilt him and he was finding
it difficult to readjust. It dawned on him that this was the first
time he had been in a combat situation - simulated or otherwise -
since the evaluation program back on Xalan. The Dart skimmed through
his sights. He fired and missed again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Why the bloody hell
haven't they loaded the ATAF's combat software onto this damn crate?”
he said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Careful there,
Dodds,” Enrique said. “You're
beginning to sound like Estelle.” He took his eyes off his systems
for a moment, trying to guess which of the three TAFs he could snatch
a glimpse of through the Ray's canopy might be Dodds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Shut it, mate, this
is really starting to annoy me!” Dodds retorted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The frustration in the
voice made Enrique start to chuckle. He looked over at Chaz, sat next
to him, whose face split into what Enrique recognised as a rare
smile. It vanished almost as soon as it had appeared, the big man
diverting the Ray's heading
as the missile-lock warning sounded. His attempt at evasion came too
late and the Ray rocked as the missile slammed into the topside of
the fighter, both men feeling the heavy vibration coarse through
their bodies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sorry,” Enrique
said for allowing himself to become distracted, before refocusing on
the battle. Chaz called up a damage report. It indicated that both
the top and frontal shield quadrants had collapsed, but were
recovering slowly. As the missile had detonated the force of the
explosion had driven its way through the shield and to the Ray's
armour beneath. The damage incurred by the armour had not been
insignificant, but not as critical as it had felt.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Are you two all
right?” Estelle asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We've
sustained moderate damage. Shielding is running at sixty percent
efficiency,” Chaz reported back. “Nothing we can't
handle.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle glanced at her
radar, seeing a red triangle sitting right in the middle; almost
right on top of her. A moment later the four pale grey rear fins and
bright cyan glow of the Dart's single engine swept across her cockpit
view. She immediately gave chase.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As she closed in on the
fighter she saw something detach itself from one of the fins, the
object arcing up around it. She swore as too late she realised what
was happening, her on-board computer sounding the warning for only a
couple of seconds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Such was the range from
its target that the missile completed its manoeuvre within a matter
of seconds and slammed headlong into her TAF, creating a blinding
white flash as the explosion blended in with the bright blue
splinters from her collapsed shielding. The starfighter rattled with
the impact, jostling Estelle in her seat and making the young woman
lunge for the ejection handle. The expected prompt to bail out never
came, however, the rattling ceasing a short time later.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Estelle!” Dodds'
voice sounded in her comms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm
okay, I'm okay,” Estelle replied, thankful that her voice had not
betrayed the terror she had felt upon seeing what she believed was
her own death hurtling straight towards her. Out of the corner of her
eye she saw an explosion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Target down,”
Kelly once again reported. The Dart that had attacked Enrique and
Chaz had pulled out of its dive and flown right in front of her,
bringing itself dead on to her heading. It had aligned within her
cross hairs and Kelly had only to pull the trigger. Her TAF's
cannons had fired four times, the first pair of bolts slamming into
the rear of the ship, followed by the second. The third pair
completed the task whilst the fourth had disappeared into the
explosion, striking remnants of the destroyed fighter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hey, leave some for
the rest of us,” Dodds said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“This isn't
a game, Dodds!” Estelle barked back. “Concentrate on taking down
that last fighter.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With his companions
dead, and now even more out-numbered and out-gunned than ever, the
final Dart pilot swung around, put full power to their engines and
began to flee from the naval pilots as fast as they could, resuming
their attempt to reach the far-off jumpgate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The four fighters gave
chase, each attempting to bring down the final fleeing craft. The
Dart was fast, faster than the <I>Knights</I>,
and it would soon be out of range of their guns; but not their
missiles.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle's
targeting computer jingled. She declared her lock. The others
acknowledged her. The missile armed and fired.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
At the same instant her
comms crackled into life. “I won't
go back there! Please don't
make me go back! I beg you!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
It was not a voice that
she at first recognised and as the small red triangle on her radar
screen started to blink, Estelle realised that it was coming from the
fighter she had just fired at. “They can't be stopped! They'll kill
me! They'll kill you! They'll
kill all of us!! Please, just let me go! I just want to get away from
them! PLEASE!” the voice continued as the missile devoured the
distance between itself and the target it sought.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Something inside
Estelle made her regret firing. There was terror in the man's
voice; a terror that, for some unexplained reason, caused her a great
deal of discomfort. It was the kind of terror that sounded as though
it had been ingrained into the man's very soul. She looked down at
the TAF's controls, seeking
a way, any way, to put a stop to the missile that was seconds away
from destroying its target. She found none and looked back to the
final floundering manoeuvres of the Dart as the missile closed.</P>

<P CLASS="western">
The craft exploded,
killing its helpless occupant and leaving Estelle with questions that
might now never be answered. She slowed her TAF and stared ahead at
the tumbling clutter of alloys. The others joined her, Dodds and
Kelly coming along either side, though not close enough to identify
the faces within the helmets.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Nice shooting,
Estelle,” Dodds said, although his enthusiasm came across as
somewhat subdued and muted, the rush of the battle dampened.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What the hell was
that all about?” Kelly asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I... I have no
idea,” Estelle replied. It sounded too real to have been a bluff.
The man's final words had
been almost hysterical and they were still going around in her head,</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
“<I>I won't
go back there...”</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Go back where?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
“<I>They'll

They'll kill us all!”</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Who was going to kill
him? Who were the people in the Darts? Why were those they were
fleeing so intent on attacking the Confederation and her allies?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She was regretting her
actions and now wanted nothing more than to have brought the man back
to Spirit for questioning. She looked to her radar and saw Enrique
and Chaz pulling up beneath the three of them. “How you guys doing
down there. Any further damage?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Silence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Chaz? How we
looking,” Enrique prompted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Same. Minor
structural damage. Shielding is still at sixty percent,” Chaz
replied.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You okay, man?”
Enrique's voice came after a pause.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah,” Chaz
answered. “Just need to make sure we're good for the rest of the
patrol.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle noted that the
man sounded somewhat distracted. She began to ponder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What now, Estelle?”
Dodds asked after a moment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We... er... transfer
a report of our findings and the battle back to Spirit Orbital,”
she said, watching as what remained of the Dart continued to tumble,
short and explode ahead of her. “Chaz, Enrique, could you... please
send them a detailed report of your damage so that... they... er...
so they can be prepared to handle it effectively upon our return.
Kelly, ensure you have a record of the fighters you took down; just
their USIDs will do. After we're
done... we'll continue with the patrol. We still have a while before
quitting time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle turned to one
of the TAFs, the pilot watching her closely. She saw them turn back
to the front and then heard a private channel open.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Are you okay?” It
was Dodds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm
fine, Dodds.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Really?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes. Please set
yourself back on the patrol route. I'll
join you in a moment, I just need to make a note of something,”
Estelle said before cutting off the link. She watched as Dodds pulled
away from her, Kelly following after him, before placing her comms on
mute and putting on her over her chest. She could feel her heart
thumping hard. The words of the man were still running around in her
head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Calm down, Estelle.
Calm down,” she said to herself, exhaling a deep breath. “He only
did it to freak you out and you took the bait. You didn't have to
bail out and you've had
worse than that before. Calm down. Finish the patrol, get home, have
some food, a drink and a good rest.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
It was the first real
combat she had experienced in months, but it somehow felt a lot more
real than usual. She closed her eyes and counted slowly to ten,
distancing herself from the event.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Everyone ready?”
she asked once she believed she had given them adequate time to send
their reports. The others reported that they were and Estelle led
them back along the patrol route.</P>

<B STYLE="font-size:1.16em;">N</B>ot
long after returning to their designated route, the <I>White
Knights</I> received new orders:
they were requested to assist <I>CSN
Cardinal</I>, a mobile research
facility vessel, which had been attacked and boarded by a raiding
party. As the <I>Knights</I>
arrived within the vicinity of the <I>Cardinal</I>
they found it drifting, damaged, and apparently powerless.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Have you ever seen
that ship before?” Estelle asked of her team. There was a
resounding answer of “no” from all as they approached. Large
quantities of debris drifted around the area, some of which appeared
to belong to the <I>Cardinal</I>,
the rest no doubt the remains of whomever had attacked her. From the
looks of things the <I>Cardinal</I>
had been equipped with some offensive weaponry and had made a
conservative effort to defend itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm
unable to establish a comms link with <I>Cardinal</I>,”
Chaz reported. “Failure on all standard protocols.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm
going to head in and give the ship a quick sweep,” Dodds said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Dodds, wait,”
Estelle said, as she saw him begin to pull away from the rest of the
group. “Our orders are to secure the area and wait for backup to
arrive.” Though there did not appear to be any other craft in the
area, Estelle ordered the others to hold their current position and
keep a watchful eye on their radars.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Sometime later two
Confederation search and rescue vessels arrived; they only recognised
one: the <I>Merekat</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Area is secured,”
Estelle informed the captain of the <I>Merekat</I>
as the search and rescue vessel approached the <I>Cardinal</I>
and pulled up alongside it. The other vessel
held back, waiting to serve any support requests.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Affirmative, de
Winter, we're going to send
over a landing party. Please continue to monitor the area,” the
captain of the <I>Merekat</I>
said as his ship closed on the <I>Cardinal</I>
and deployed a boarding tube.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Think anyone is
alive in there?” Dodds asked of his wingmates.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“From the looks of
things they're all dead,”
Kelly said. “We probably got here a little too late.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“At least they put up
a decent fight,” Dodds commented.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Not good enough
though,” Estelle answered, raising her eyes up from her radar and
looking at the lifeless ship they had been requested to assist. She
watched as another piece of wreckage drifted toward her TAF before
bouncing harmlessly off the shielding. She could see somewhere
further off what appeared to be the remains of a small vessel,
perhaps a one-man fighter craft of some sort. She assumed the
<I>Cardinal</I> must have
been attacked by a small group of raiders, each in their own
individual craft. She dropped her eyes back down to her radar and
wondered what might be going on inside.</P>

“What are you doing?”
Enrique asked Chaz. The big man was fiddling with the Ray's
on-board computer, his fingers tapping away at the small keyboard
underneath one of the screens.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Finding out what's
going on,” he said. He continued pressing buttons and tapping at
the screen, the computer issuing an occasional bleep in response.
Enrique didn't recognise anything that was being displayed on the
screen Chaz was accessing. The general lack of finesse in the layouts
and aesthetics of the data representation suggested that the man had
accessed something that was only to be used by maintenance and
systems workers, and was not supposed to be readily available to the
pilots.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
A moment later voices
filled the cockpit and Enrique gave a start.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“This is Williams.
Docking tube fixed and stable. Moving towards airlock,” a voice
came.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Copy that, Williams.
Scans indicate some internal damage to the <I>Cardinal</I>.
Proceed with caution,” another voice answered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Will do, Captain. We
will maintain an open channel,” Williams said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What's
that?” Enrique said as he listened to the chatter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It's
the communications link being used between the boarding party and
<I>Merekat</I>,”
Chaz said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Enrique took a moment
to understand. “Wait, hold on. Did you just hack...” he began,
stunned by what the man had just done.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Shhh! Listen.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Enrique fell silent and
the two men listened in to the conversation between the boarding
party and the <I>Merekat</I><I>'</I><I>s</I>

The party leader,
Williams, stood by the <I>Cardinal</I>'s
airlock door turned to a member of his team. “Kate, would you do
the honours?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Kate produced a small
portable device and connected it via a number of cables to the
exterior airlock control panel. The door lock gave a short buzz, a
little red light on the control panel changing to green.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Open, sir,” she
said, stepping to one side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Excellent. Right,
remember everyone: no energy weapons,” Williams told his team. “We
want to minimise damage to the interior if we encounter any
hostilities.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
His team was made up of
seven, clad in dark blue, lightly armoured suits and wearing
protective helmets. On their feet they wore magnetic boots that could
be activated in low and zero gravity situations. Most of their larger
weapons were also equipped with a torch, for circumstances where they
might have to work in the dark. Aside from the weapons, the team also
carried maintenance gear, and medical supplies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The seven men and women
stood to either side of the airlock, so as not to expose themselves
to anyone who might be waiting on the other side. Williams gave Kate
the signal to open the airlock, and as the door slid open they were
met by nothing except for an empty corridor, pitch black save for
where the falloff lighting from the boarding tube illuminated the
entrance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Archer, Fisher,”
Williams indicated to the two men closest the entrance to enter
first. One after the other they ran in, shining their torches around
the immediate area. They determined that the corridor was empty, but
even so they stalked forward cautiously, still met by neither
opposition nor crew members.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Clear,” Fisher
declared. The rest of the team entered the thin corridor. Another
member removed a device from his belt and scanned the area.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Minimal power on
this deck; gravity and life support are functioning as usual. There
does appear to be more power in the direction of the upper decks,
though,” he reported.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Williams nodded. “Pair
up and spread out. Get in touch as soon you encounter survivors or
hostile forces.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The group paired off as
ordered and proceeded to explore the darkened lower deck of the ship,
carefully checking possible hiding places in various rooms and
ensuring they illuminated all unreachable areas well. With the
exception of a hacked airlock door - which they assumed the invaders
must have used to get inside - they once again came up empty-handed.
The team soon regrouped by the lift to the upper deck and found the
doors burnt and pock-marked by multiple weapon blasts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Lift is operational,
sir,” reported Kate and, at the request of Williams, pressed the
call button. The lift arrived and the doors parted, greeting the team
with the slumped body of a dead man. Blood was splattered over his
clothes and interior of the lift. The multiple lights of the
investigators fell upon a shotgun the man still grasped.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“This is Williams:
we've found a body. Judging by the way this guy is dressed, it isn't
one of the crew,” Williams reported to the <I>Merekat</I>.
“If the state of the lift is anything to go by, there has been one
hell of a firefight in here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What're we looking
at?” the captain asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Definitely a raiding
party,” Williams said, edging forward and examining the dead man's
body. He pushed aside the beaded dreadlocks that covered part of the
raider's face, revealing a tattoo of a spider's web on his left
cheek. “Cheap body armour. Didn't do him any good,” Williams
muttered, then, “We're proceeding to the upper deck.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The upper deck of the
ship told a different story to the lower. Bodies, trails of blood and
other clear signs of battle were in evidence throughout. Shorting
electronics lit the dark corridors with bright bursts of spark light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Be careful of
those,” Williams pointed out some wires that hung inconspicuously
from the ceiling.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Williams divided the
team, instructing one half to accompany him towards the bridge, and
the other to spread out along the upper deck and continue to search
for any survivors. They moved with care, ensuring they ducked under
the loose wires. The team encountered yet more bodies as they went,
none of whom displayed any signs of life. A scattering of clothing
styles suggested that the crew and their attackers had taken an equal
number of casualties.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The team discovered
most of the bodies on the bridge, some appearing to have died as a
result of close quarters combat; the unfortunate crew of the <I>Cardinal</I>
marred by stab wounds all over their bodies, some having had their
throats cut. It was a horrific scene.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Looks like the crew
tried to barricade themselves inside the bridge,” Williams reported
once more to <I>Merekat</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Any sign of what
they could have been looking for?” came the reply in his earpiece.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Nothing yet, but I'm
guessing they may have been scavengers. Looks like the <I>Cardinal</I>
was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Williams and his team
pressed on into the bridge in an attempt to gather more information.
Following a short inspection of the bridge area, Kate began examining
the ship's logs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Some data has been
downloaded from the computers,” she said, running through them. As
she spoke a screen next to her sprang into life and began churning
out information.</P>

Estelle's
eyes flashed down to her radar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Estelle!” Dodds
started.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I see it!” Estelle
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
From beneath the
<I>Cardinal</I>
a small craft emerged. Being so close to the ship it had escaped
notice by both the radar systems and the <I>Knights</I>'
own eyes. But with the activation of shielding, computer system and
engines, the vessel announced its presence to all in the vicinity as
it accelerated away from the <I>Cardinal</I>,
keeping in line with the ship's
original heading.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle cursed herself
for not performing a proper sweep of the <I>Cardinal</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm
going after it,” Dodds said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Stay put, Dodds,”
Estelle answered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I can catch it,”
Dodds insisted, manoeuvring his TAF toward the escaping craft and
preparing to give chase.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Lieutenant, you will
hold your position. That's
an order!” Estelle barked. With her own orders and duties clear in
her head she was not prepared to allow Dodds to play the hero. Dodds
had met with disaster the last time he had done so and Estelle was
not about to let him go through all that again; for his sake as well
as her own.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds backed down,
though not without further grumbling.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle contacted
<I>Merekat</I>.
“<I>Merekat</I>,
this is de Winter. Unidentified craft has been spotted departing
<I>Cardinal.</I>
Please advise.” After destroying the Dart earlier, she was not
prepared to allow another error of judgement lead to an action that
she would later come to regret.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As she awaited the
answer from <I>Merekat</I>,
the space ahead of the escaping craft began to distort and twist. The
distortion quickly began to subside, leaving behind a steady rotating
swirl. The craft sped into the swirling mass, disappearing from
sight, whereupon the portal vanished and the surrounding space
returned to normal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle blinked in
disbelief. “What the hell just happened?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I don't know,”
Dodds said, taken aback. “Did that ship just open a jump point?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, that's
impossible,” Kelly said. “It's far too small to be equipped with
jump engines.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle looked from her
radar to the <I>Cardinal</I>
and back again, trying to make sense of what she had just seen.</P>

“<I>Cardinal</I>
just opened a timed jump point,” Kate informed Williams. The man
walked over to investigate the screens the woman was looking at. He
relayed the information to <I>Merekat</I><I>'</I><I>s</I>
captain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Try and determine
what the destination was,” the captain answered. “And be careful;
an unidentified craft just departed the <I>Cardinal</I>
and escaped via that jump point. If it was hostile then there may
still be others on the ship. Be on your guard and take extra
precautions.”</P>

In another part of the
<I>Cardinal</I><I>'</I><I>s</I>
upper deck, Archer had found a number of men and women lying on the
floor of a room up ahead, all bound and gagged. They all appeared to
be unconscious; or perhaps dead.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“This is Archer, I
may have found survivors,” he radioed. “Looks like someone's tied
them all up. I'm going to
check the bodies and then help anyone still alive off the ship.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He started forward. The
people opened their eyes as they became aware of his approach and
started shaking their heads and screaming at him through their gags.
It did not occur to him what they were trying to tell him until he
stepped through the doorway.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Too late he saw the
thin red beams of the lasers break as his hand passed through them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Aw, hell...”
Archer began.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The explosives went
off, the blasts ripping their way through the ship. A wall of fire
squeezed itself down the corridors, engulfing everything in its path.</P>

Chaz and Enrique were
amongst the first to hear the sound, but it was not until fire burst
forth from the bridge, forcing glass, ship parts and bodies ahead of
it, that they realised what they had heard and became aware of the
crisis.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Get to a safe
distance! Move! Move! Move!” Estelle shouted to her wingmates. The
<I>Knights</I>
swung their fighters around and pulled away from the <I>Cardinal</I>
as quickly as they could, retreating back away from the ship they had
been called in to help.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>Merekat</I>
was not so lucky. The <I>Cardinal</I>'s
midsection exploded, damaging the search and rescue vessel that was
still attached to it. Before long the explosion that Archer had
triggered found its way to the <I>Cardinal</I><I>'</I><I>s</I>
reactor and the two ships were torn apart by the tremendous force of
the blast.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The <I>Knights</I>
sat motionless for a moment, watching a section of one of the ships
tumbling before them. Not long after Estelle was contacted by the
second rescue ship, which identified itself as <I>CSN
Buffalo</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Together the five craft
set about searching for signs of any possible survivors amongst the
carnage, no matter how futile it seemed. None were found. As had been
feared, no-one aboard <I>Merekat</I>
had been able to get to the escape pods in time, or had a chance to
protect themselves against the cold vacuum of space. The search for
survivors changed to a search for bodies and, after picking up all
that they could find, <I>Buffalo</I>
called an end to the sweep. Finally, after recovering the black boxes
from the <I>Cardinal</I>
and <I>Merekat</I>,
<I>Buffalo</I>
signalled to the <I>Knights</I>
it was ready to leave.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“There's

“This is an utter
disaster!” Turner grated, holding his head in his hands as he read
the reports detailing the fates of the <I>Cardinal</I>
and <I>Merekat</I>.
Though they had yet to be fully sorted and collated, it had not
proven difficult to piece together a picture of exactly what had
happened earlier that evening.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks had returned to
Xalan upon hearing the news. He now stood before Turner, waiting as
the admiral went over each of the reports, knowing that they did not
make for pleasant reading.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What the hell was
<I>Cardinal</I>
doing there without some sort of escort?” Turner growled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“According to Spirit
Orbital they had reported a suspected case of Shizaru's
Fever aboard and had performed an emergency jump into Temper.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Turner stared at him
incredulously. “Shizaru's
Fever? The disease that induces deaf-blindness?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir,” Parks
said, though he found himself sharing Turner's
scepticism.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“There's
not been a confirmed or even reported case of that for over one
hundred years. They should have followed proper procedure instead of
trying to handle it themselves,” Turner grumbled. “Just our
damned luck that raiders would choose a research ship to hit. This is
precisely why we need to step up patrols in all sectors. This event
could have been easily avoided if we'd simply had more manpower.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks nodded, even
though he knew that it wasn't a real solution; Turner was clutching
at straws. The bigger issue was what had been taken from <I>Cardinal</I>.
The moment word had reached him that the ship had been attacked and
destroyed, Parks prayed that was all that had happened. As the
reports from the various witnesses had come in, he had heard that a
craft had fled the scene moments before the ship's
destruction. But not before a dump had been taken from the computer
systems, copied onto a data card and then, presumably, taken on board
the fleeing vessel.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks mused. As a
mobile research facility <I>Cardinal</I>
had held much of the Confederation's
project work, acting as an extreme kind of disaster recovery service.
It therefore held a lot of important data; though none as important
as those pertaining to the ATAF project, as both he and Turner knew
full well. It was all there: every schema, blueprint, theory,
problem, solution, purpose; the list went on.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The <I>Cardinal</I><I>'</I><I>s</I>
black box had proven to be a treasure trove of information, detailing
all the events leading up to the ship's
untimely destruction. As well as letting the CSN know the nature of
the data that had been downloaded onto the data card, it had also
revealed the destination of the jump point the thief had used to
escape. And Parks had almost despaired when he had discovered it led
into Imperial space. Of all the places the thief could have chosen to
go.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Upon hearing the news
Turner had conversed with the Confederate Administration, who had
been quick to assign a number of agents to the task of recovering the
assumed stolen data. The investigation was then placed at the top of
the Navy's priority list and
Turner had summoned Parks to Xalan.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That fool of a
raider thinks he is going to earn himself a tidy little sum by
selling on military secrets,” Turner growled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“The data is heavily
encrypted, sir,” Parks offered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That's
beside the point, Commodore!” Turner snapped back at him. “With
the resources available to them the Enemy could crack it within a
matter of months.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Turner rose from his
chair, taking one of the reports with him. Parks glanced over at the
cabinet by the wall. The admiral was out of White Label whiskey.
Turner started to pace, mumbling aloud the summarised timeline of
events, as detailed by Spirit Orbital station,</P>

“First <I>Dragon</I>
and now this,” Turner stopped reading the log of the events and
tossed the report back onto the desk to join the rest. He stood
staring out the window, contemplating.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“They'd still need to
build the ATAFs,” said Parks, once again attempting to reassure the
admiral. “That would take them several months, even after they'd
deciphered the data. And as far as we have been able to determine the
Enemy don't retain any
knowledge of starfighter construction.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, they could do it
much quicker than that,” Turner said as he picked up another report
and began going over it. “Unlike us the Enemy do not require
sign-offs, approvals, security, money... They don't
have to justify an enormous military budget; they don't
have to gloss over expenditure or attempt to keep the project under
wraps; they don't have to
sit in a boardroom full of suits trying to explain, in basic terms,
the long-term implications of non-action. It doesn't
matter that they might not understand starfighter engineering; with
the information about the ATAFs in their hands they'll certainly make
the effort to learn. And damn quickly at that, too.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“If...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You've
seen first hand what that fighter is capable of,” Turner went on,
ignoring the commodore. “Imagine facing several dozen of those in
combat. Combine that with the Enemy's
abilities and we might as well arm everyone with low-grade particle
cannons for all the good it would do. Then there's all the other
information they will have become privy to. We would have to step up
the final phase of the project without any guarantees.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Turner picked up
another report, reading it to himself for a time before glancing up
at Parks and quoting a passage out loud. “<I>Upon
resuming our patrol we were contacted by Spirit Orbital who requested
that we assist </I>CSN
Cardinal<I>,
which had come under attack. We arrived to find signs of recent
combat and the </I>Cardinal<I>
damaged. I ordered that the area be made secure until the search and
rescue teams could arrive.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I
see the <I>White
Knights</I> were at the scene.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir. They were
patrolling the area when they received the request to aid <I>Cardinal</I>.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“And they were unable
to take down a single escaping craft?” Turner demanded to know.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Those details are
sketchy, sir. The wing leader believed she was acting within a
support capacity and did not act because she was not ordered to.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“de Winter was
leading the wing?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“She should have had
that ship blown to pieces the moment it was clear of <I>Cardinal</I>,”
Turner growled, flipping backwards through the pages. He had received
the reports less than an hour before Parks'
arrival and there was much in them that he had skipped over, turning
straight to the most important parts. “Apparently they also
encountered some unknown hostilities on their patrol... What the
hell's this?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sir?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“This part of about
some transmission!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“The <I>Knights</I>
received an unusual message that they thought was report-worthy,”
Parks explained, recalling reading it himself on the journey over.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Turner read back to get
the full details of the transmission. Displeasure etched deeper into
his face as he read on. Parks knew without having to be told what the
admiral was thinking: this shouldn't
be here. It all had to go. The pilot's
words would lead to questions; questions which would then lead to
truths; and truths that would lead to panic on quite literally a
galactic scale. And then the Enemy would win.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Remove it,” Turner
said, dropping the report back onto his desk. “As far as anyone is
concerned those men were Imperial asylum seekers fleeing their
system's civil war. They
stole three ships and ran the check points in the Alba system before
jumping to Temper. Their ships were destroyed after they failed to
identify themselves upon request to a Naval patrol unit, which they
had also attacked.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir. I'll
have that updated for the final report,” Parks assured him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Ensure it is, as
well as the traffic and activity record at Alba.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“And have someone
take the <I>Knights</I>
aside and ensure they do not repeat what they heard. I don't care who
you get to do it: yourself, Meyers, Hawke, or whoever. Just make sure
the message is clear. We need all our bases covered on this one.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks nodded again.
“I'll have it done as soon as we've wrapped this up, admiral.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Good. I have to
leave soon to meet with those clowns in Office and I don't
wish to spend any more time with damage control,” Turner growled
once again, as if blaming Parks for the presence of the offending
sentences. “Now, before all of this crap started, I believe you
said that you had some news for me?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I do,” Parks said
with a wry smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Turner scowled at the
commodore's sudden bright face. “I hope it's
<I>good</I> news,
Commodore.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It's

Officer's
Club at Mandelah Naval Base was filled to capacity. Most days, the
Club was not as packed as it was tonight, but the actions of the
<I>White
Knights</I> two days previous had
set in motion a series of rumours that had resulted in as many
service personnel squeezing themselves into the building as possible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Word of mouth had
spread that a pilot named Kelly (first name unknown) had engaged and
taken down two enemy starfighters, making their way through
Confederation space. The exact identity of the “enemy” did not
seem to be known and neither was it important. By further word of
mouth, it had become four enemy vessels, who were en route to torpedo
Spirit Orbital. Kelly had been patrolling on his own when he had
encountered the enemy, and had therefore been unable to fall back on
any wingmates for assistance (at this point, Kelly had also been
identified as a man, or “one hell of a guy”). In the end, he had
become the sole responsibility for the defence and evacuation of a
heavily packed naval transporter, that was acting as the enemy's
secondary target.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">

The drink was flowing
quite freely that night, with much singing and dancing. The pool
tables were receiving a great deal more attention than they would
normally, with various wagers being played out non-stop. A tall,
skinny man by the name of O'Reilly
was enjoying a lot of success with the cue, many challengers
attempting to break his winning streak and soon parting with their
cash.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With everything going
on, Estelle wondered just who was watching how much everyone was
drinking. Certainly not Captain Meyers, who had been absent from the
base for the past two days, disappearing straight after the <I>Knights</I>
had returned from their patrol. Earlier on, she had seen a couple of
the more senior officers perched on stools by the bar, making sure
that people didn't overdo it; but they were not exactly enforcing the
usual rules of responsible alcohol consumption on others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“... of all the
places that we could have wound up in. Kelly?” Estelle said,
raising her eyes from her glass and discovering Kelly to be
preoccupied. “Kelly?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The brown-haired girl
turned back to Estelle. “Sorry, Estelle, what did you say?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Too busy in your own
little world, as usual,” Estelle muttered, wishing her friend would
listen to her ranting, so she could get it off her chest. “Sometimes
I think you really are just like your sisters.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Kelly recoiled on her
stool. “Oh, thanks, Estelle. Thanks a lot,” she said, sounding
both hurt and angered by Estelle's
words. “I thought if there was just one person in this world who
wouldn't continue to bring
that up, it would be you. Why people constantly feel the need to
judge me on that, I'll never
know.”</P>

A gathering of eight
men and women, standing not too far from Estelle and Kelly's
table, lowered their drinks to watch the scene unfolding.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What's
going on?” asked a man to the group, noting the scowl on Kelly's
face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“The neurotic one and
the spoilt one are fighting,” one of his drinking companions
answered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That doesn't
surprise me,” said another. “I don't
think there's a single
person on the base that de Winter hasn't
picked a fight with.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What exactly is her
problem?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Ego,” a woman put
bluntly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That Kelly Taylor?”
one of the other men asked, with a nod of his beer bottle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, that's
de Winter. Taylor's the one having a go.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Oh.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Why, do you like
that?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“She's
not bad.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Don't
bother. I share quarters with her. Really full of herself, that one.
Kelly's nicer, even if she's
quite dizzy.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Could someone
explain to me why she is even here?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What do you mean?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Well, if I were her,
I wouldn't be here. I'd
be spending all that money her father's
got.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You know, you're a
real credit to the service.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, I'm just making
a point. You probably would, too.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Like her sisters?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You know, I heard
she hates them?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, she doesn't
hate them; they just don't
get on.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Tell you what, I
wish my Dad had done that.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Done what?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Been a galactic
commodities trader.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It wasn't
her Dad, it was her great, great grandfather, or something like
that.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You wouldn't
be able to do it these days anyway. The market for that sort of thing
was only around for a short time, before all the larger corporations
started to get in on the act. He was a smart man, you got to give him
that.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What are they
fighting about?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I don't
know and I don't care.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Several of the group
turned their backs on the two women, going back to what they had been
talking about before they had been distracted. One only half turned
back, leaning ever so slightly in the table's
direction, intrigued to hear what had riled Kelly so much.</P>

“I can't
help being who I am, Estelle. I didn't ask to be born into my
family,” Kelly was continuing her rant, Estelle not saying a word.
“And I'm not like Susan
and Gemma at all. If I was, I wouldn't
be here for a start. I'd be
being snapped by photographers, falling out of cars and nightclubs,
so drunk I don't know what
day it is; working my way through some football team; or joining the
ranks of the no-knicker club. You know, my sisters don't
even know what I do? I've been with the CSN for nearly ten bloody
years and they think that I'm
a soldier, part of the Mobile Infantry.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“And speaking of
which, you need to stop trying to make up for what happened to Jed.
At least he wasn't killed
and could walk away from it...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Kelly stopped talking
as the sentence left her mouth, instantly regretting her choice of
words. Estelle and her brother had both taken up military careers at
the same time, Estelle joining the CSN and her brother the CMI. Her
brother had lasted only two years before he had returned home. An
accident during a live fire exercise had resulted in a bullet
shattering his kneecap and leaving him with a permanent limp.
Estelle's family had been
unable to afford the corrective surgery.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She looked uneasily
around the Officer's Club
for a moment, before turning back to Estelle. In for a penny, in for
a pound; she may as well get it all out now. Better Estelle hear it
from her than somebody else.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, okay, I know I
can be flaky sometimes, but the others have accepted that and I don't
see why you can't. And to be
fair, I think that I do make up for that in the cockpit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Look, you need to
stop wanting so much, so quickly. You said you want to one day
command your own carrier, or battleship or whatever; but if you keep
on making enemies here then you're
not going to get there because people will find you difficult to work
with. Haven't you noticed
how everyone in the dorm tiptoes around you? Doesn't that bother you?
I mean, what the hell, Estelle, are you going to be a bitch your
whole life?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle said nothing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Kelly plunged on
further. “And to be honest, we have had a rather intense few weeks
with the training, the back and forth transfers from Gabriel, to
Temper, to here, and then the constant up and down to the station.
And let's not forget the
little incident a few days ago. I think we deserve to let our hair
down from time to time. <I>Lieutenant</I>.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Her tirade over, Kelly
started to wonder if she had taken things a bit far, Estelle still
saying nothing, looking anywhere but at Kelly. She caught the eyes of
a group of people standing nearby, who were quick to look away. The
two women sat in silence for a time, looking anywhere but at each
other, and playing with their drinks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sorry,” they both
said at the same time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm
sorry,” Estelle said again, sweeping her hair out of her face.
“It's just that...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You don't
want to be here,” Kelly filled in for her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I look at all of
this,” Estelle gestured around herself. “And I wonder where I
went wrong. We've just gone
from being the pick of the best to some dingy backwater system, shut
away from the other squadrons, to a place where very little happens.
There don't seem to be any
prospects for promotion, getting out or even any real recognition. I
almost feel like the only thing left for me to do would be to quit.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Quit?” Kelly said,
stunned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle shrugged.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Estelle, look, it's
just a transitional period. We're
not going to be here forever,” Kelly said. Despite her words, Kelly
knew that Estelle would never quit, the woman was far too proud to do
something like that. She'd
sooner die than admit it to her family or herself. “For now, this
is just something we have to do. Listen, why don't
you come running with me and the boys tomorrow, instead of bothering
yourself with so much flag duty. It will help you to keep your mind
off things like that.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle opened her
mouth to answer and then fell quiet. Kelly watched her, stirring her
straw through the clutter of ice cubes, being all that now remained
of her cocktail.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah, okay,”
Estelle said. “I guess I have been neglecting all you guys
recently.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Good, good,” Kelly
smiled. Estelle smiled back. Satisfied that even though she had been
treading on very thin ice she had made her point, Kelly relaxed more.
She once again looked over in the direction of Dodds, Enrique and
Chaz who were sitting not far from them, on a long couch in the
corner.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle began to
chuckle. “Don't stare at
him, Kelly.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I wasn't,”
Kelly said. “I was just wondering who was winning their game.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hmmmmmm.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Don't you sometimes
miss being with Dodds?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“My drink's all gone,
Lieutenant,” Estelle said, crunching at the ice cubes with her
straw.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Kelly smiled. Estelle
was playfully abusing her position. She stepped off her stool. “Same
again?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Same again. And stop
looking over there,” she added as Kelly walked back to the bar.</P>

Estelle did, however,
look over herself. She had noticed how Chaz was sitting with Dodds
and Enrique, and a number of other servicemen, merrily enjoying the
game. His usual cold demeanour seemed to have evaporated tonight,
making him a lot more approachable. Even so, she could tell he was
still keeping things close to his chest. Tonight, he was neither
being too quiet nor too loud, either of which could cause one to
stand out. He was acting like a real blend-in, instantly forgettable.
He also appeared to be drinking at a modest pace; and disguising that
well, too.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She could not figure
the man out and had heard from Enrique about how he had hacked the
Ray's on-board comms
systems, to hook into the <I>Merekat</I>.
Nothing more had been said, Estelle withholding his actions from the
post-patrol report. In any case, she was beginning to wonder just who
Parks had assigned to her wing. As she waited for Kelly to return,
she did her best to watch the group of men without making it too
obvious.</P>

“You in, Chaz?”
Enrique asked as he shuffled the cards once again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sure.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Dodds?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“How about you four?
Who are you again?” Enrique asked the men sitting on the couch
opposite him. They burst out laughing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The group were playing
poker, with Enrique acting as dealer. For the most part they were
playing for fun, but one of the four men that Dodds, Enrique and Chaz
sat with had decided to sneak a bottle of whiskey in with him,
intending to use it as an ice-breaker. The strong liquor had now
taken on a new role as a penalty for anyone who played an appalling
hand. This was becoming quite a regular occurrence for Enrique, who
had failed to beat any of the other players in the last few rounds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You know, mate, if
this were a casino you'd be looking for a new job round about now,”
Dodds said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Dude, how much you
'ad?” asked the first man.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Too much already, by
the looks of things,” the second man said. “Clearly can't hold
his drink.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Oh, I can,”
Enrique defended himself. “I'm not that drunk.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Okay, so what's our
names again?” the first man said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Enrique paused for a
moment. Dodds watched him thinking, stealing a glance at Chaz who was
taking a relaxing swig from his beer bottle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Tell you what,”
Enrique said. “Why don't I just call you Crew Cut, Tubby, Irish and
Shy Boy.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The four men exchanged
incensed looks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Well, you can't say
they're not accurate,” Enrique slurred a little.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Oi,” began Tubby,
glaring. “My name's Ian.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds reached out and
put a hand on Enrique's shoulder. “No harm, boys,” he said,
giving his friend's shoulder a little squeeze to stop him saying any
more. “Just some friendly nicknames, that's all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“And besides, I've
lost weight recently,” Ian grumbled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Where did you get
Irish from? The whiskey?” the one Enrique had christened said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Your accent,”
Enrique said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“My accent?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm Scottish, you
cretin! I'm a McLeod!” the man growled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What should we call
you two, then?” Crew said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hey, wait, I know
these two,” McLeod interrupted. “You're Simon Dodds and Enrique
Todd: The Odd Brothers.” A quizzical look crossed the faces of his
three companions. McLeod elaborated, “These guys were pretty much
inseparable at flight school. Never used to be far from one another.
We ended up calling them the Odd Brothers because they were so much
like family.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah, thanks,”
Dodds said, holding up his hand as if to brush away the conversation
and the embarrassing memories that it evoked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Weren't you dating
that girl, Esther or something? The one who thought the sun shone out
of her arse?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Estelle. Yeah, that
one,” Dodds admitted, seeing McLeod look around briefly in the
direction of the woman sat at a table by herself. “But, no we're
not seeing each other any more. She said she didn't have time for me
and wanted to focus on her career.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Shame,” McLeod
observed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Why is she like
that? So self absorbed, I mean,” Crew asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“She wants to make
something of herself,” Dodds started.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah, that's
obvious,” Crew scoffed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, that's not what
I mean. She doesn't come from a particularly well-off family,”
Dodds said. “She was born on one of colonies on Tilli; so you know
how it is out there. They never had a lot of money and had to get by
mostly on state benefits. Her parents worked whenever they could find
it, but again, you've heard how it is there. She quit school early so
that she could try and help bring in some cash, but it didn't make a
whole lot of difference. They couldn't even up sticks: they couldn't
afford to settle down anywhere else, let alone afford the cost of
transport in the first place. So, she joined the Navy to prove to her
family and herself that she was worth more than all of that. She
sends most of the money she earns home to them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Ah,” McLeod said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hmmmm,” Dodds
added. Whilst he was aware that he had just dished out a great deal
of very personal information about a friend to a group of men he
didn't know, he was only trying to defend the Estelle that he knew
better than others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Still,” McLeod
said, glancing back over to Estelle, who was taking a glass from
Kelly, “Shame to have let that one go.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Oh, she's been known
to change her mind from time to time,” Enrique said, with a grin.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Well, at least until
the next morning,” Dodds finished. He then wagged a finger at
McLeod. “Getting back to things: Yeah, I sort of remember you now,
too. Been a long time; nice to see you again.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah, you too,”
McLeod said. “Drink this.” He thrust a whiskey glass, half-filled
with the neat liquor, toward Dodds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds withdrew and
directed it towards Enrique. “You came up with the names.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Enrique reluctantly
took the glass and downed it in one, coughing a couple of times
before handing it back. “After this round, I will be passing the
dealing over to my good friend Dodds here,” he drawled, scooping
his beer off the table and knocking back a good amount of the
contents. “I really hate whiskey,” he said to Dodds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Aw, God no, <I>come
on</I>,” Ian said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
At first, Dodds thought
that the man was upset that he was not going to get a chance to see
Enrique make a speckle of himself. He then saw that the eyes of the
four opposite him were looking, not at Enrique, but to his left.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Sitting next to Enrique
were a couple whose public display of affection for one another was
beginning to encroach far too much on the poker game and everyone's
enjoyment. When the male half of the couple had asked if he could sit
on the end of the couch, none had expected that his companion was
then going to be sitting on <I>him</I>
for the rest of the evening – although, from Dodds' angle, sitting
on him might not have been the best way to describe the way the woman
had been clambering all over the man for the last fifteen minutes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Guys, guys!
Seriously, Romeo, get a room!” Enrique scowled at them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“And you're
the guy to ask about that, are you?” the man answered him, managing
to wrench his lips away from those of his eager companion. “Don't
suppose you've noticed, but
there's little in the way of
privacy around here, them not giving us private quarters like that
lot up on the orbital.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, I hadn't
noticed actually,” Enrique said. “But I think you'll
find there are a few spare mattresses in the south block storage
room. Shouldn't be too cold
in there, neither.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds found himself
impressed at both his friend's knowledge of Mandelah's logistical
offerings and the fact that the tip seemed to do the trick. The man
whispered to the woman he was with for a moment, before the pair got
up. He clapped Enrique on the shoulder a couple of times as they
left. Dodds watched them go, his attention straying to the two women
seated on tall stools, at a just as tall round table, chuckling to
one another.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle was looking
particularly cheery tonight. It was nice to see her this way,
especially after the disappointment she had suffered following the
termination of their involvement in the ATAF project. She glanced at
the men sitting around the low table and, catching his eye, smiled at
Dodds. He smiled back, then returned his attention back to the game
at hand.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“So, why'd
you boys join the Navy, then?” Crew asked as they picked up the
cards Enrique had dealt and scrutinised them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Well,” Dodds
began, seeing the group's gaze fall on him. “I didn't
want to do the whole nine to five thing, just didn't
interest me. I wanted to get out there and see and do things, find a
bit of adventure. Wanted to feel like I was a bit more than some cog
in a big old machine, that could work just as well without me. So, at
the end of the day it was either this or spend my life looking after
apples.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He watched their
impassive expressions for a moment and then saw Ian's face split into
a grin.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Ahhhh,” Ian said,
with a chuckle. “So, you wanted to join the Navy and become a
hero!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No,” Dodds said,
sitting back up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah, you did,”
Ian began to laugh. “You thought that if you joined the Navy, you'd
get to blow stuff up, go on daring missions, earn tons of medals and
get to sleep with lots of beautiful women.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, I just wanted to
do something different, you know – give something back to the
Confederacy; be a part of something special,” Dodds said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“See,” Crew
interrupted. “You <I>did</I>
want to be a hero.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
All four men were
laughing at Dodds. He turned toward Enrique and Chaz, seeking
support, but saw that they too were enjoying the roast; Enrique
shaking his head, Chaz wearing a thin smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>Sure,
I did want to be a hero, once</I>, Dodds thought to himself.
<I>But I'm back here for
different reasons now.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What about you?”
Crew turned his attention to Enrique, who shielded his cards in case
there was some ploy against him. Dodds looked around at his friend,
curious as to how Enrique might answer the question. Few outside the
<I>Knights</I>'
small group were aware of Enrique's
back story. Dodds was not even sure if Enrique had ever told Chaz.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
When he was eight years
old, Enrique and his family had been returning from celebrating his
older brother's tenth
birthday. They had been in a car travelling along a motorway, when
his father had noticed a truck on the other side of the road driving
erratically. Enrique's
father had taken precautions, deciding to slow and switch lanes. Just
as he had done so, the truck had swerved, crashing through the
central reservation and tipping onto its side, careening towards
them. The rear of the truck had clipped their car and sent it
tumbling, at speed, up the roadside embankment. It came to rest back
on the road, leaving a trail of broken and crumpled chassis parts and
shattered glass behind it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Emergency services had
been quick to arrive at the scene. His mother, older brother and
little sister were pulled from the wreckage of their car, but had
been pronounced dead at the scene. Along with his father, Enrique had
been air-lifted to the nearest hospital. Despite all the efforts of
the emergency teams, his father had died en route, owing to massive
internal bleeding. Enrique had survived with a broken arm.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He was raised by his
grandfather, an ex-military and spiritual man, who never failed to
impress upon him the fact that someone was looking out for him and
that he had survived the crash for a reason. Enrique took the words
to heart and, spurred on by his grandfather, had signed up for the
Navy, in order to protect others and do his best to save lives and
keep the peace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
It was not, however, a
story that he would often tell.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Figured the Navy was
something I would enjoy,” Enrique said with a shrug. “And I was
no good at anything else.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sounds like that
should have been your reason,” Ian said, laughing once again at
Dodds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You?” Crew looked
at Chaz. So did Dodds and Enrique, more intrigued than the man asking
the questions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I used to fly
interplanetary shuttles and landers,” Chaz said dismissively.
“After nearly ten years of doing that, I wanted to see and do
something more. The police force didn't
interest me: too much corruption. So I applied to the Navy. So far,
I've been stationed in more
than ten different star systems over the past eight years and learned
to fly over half a dozen different starfighters.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Oh, okay,” Crew
said. There was no sarcasm from Ian or McLeod over the explanation;
Chaz, for some reason, didn't seem to warrant it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz took a slow pull
from his bottle, saying nothing else.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Girlfriend, wife,
kids?” McLeod said, rolling his hand around.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“None to speak of,”
Chaz said after considerable pause.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“He's like your
mate,” Enrique supplied, nodding at the fourth man of the group,
who had contributed little to the conversation. “Man of few words.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The other three went on
to explain their reasons for joining up, how Crew's parents disagreed
with his career choice because he was basically being granted a
license to murder. He argued he was being trained to protect and that
the need to take a life was a wholly real and necessary part of that
duty. His parents had asked if he ever raised a thought for the
people in the ships he gunned down. Ian chipped in and said that to
him the enemy were faceless anyway, and may as well be robots. He
commented that no-one thought about who they may have just killed
when they destroyed their fighter. It didn't
matter to them that it may have been someone's
only child, a mother, a father of two, a brother or sister. At the
end of the day, they were the enemy and that was all that mattered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Getting a bit deep,”
Dodds said as the group lapsed into silence, a sombre bubble seeming
to have enclosed the group. The cheerful mood was threatening to
abandon them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I think I'm
sobering up,” Enrique said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, let's
play,” McLeod pushed aside a couple of cards. “Deal me two more.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Enrique leaned forward
to the little table the deck rested on and, after making a bit of a
mess of the pile, managed to hand the man two more cards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hey, no really, do
you know what I've been
hearing lately?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds looked up from
his cards for the source of the voice and realised it belonged to the
man who had remained relatively quiet for most of the game; the one
Enrique had called Shy Boy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I've
been told that there's no Imperial civil war,” Shy said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What's
that?” Dodds said as the others lowered their cards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>There is no war</I>,”
Shy repeated, emphasising the statement a little more this time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You mean they're
just making it up?” said Enrique.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Not entirely, but
they are definitely trying to cover something up. Something really
bad's happened over there
and they don't want people
to find out about it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You think they've
been attacked by aliens?” asked Ian excitedly, as the others
pondered the statement.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, not bloody
aliens!” Shy said, turning to him with a look of utter disdain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You've got to admit,
that'd be pretty cool,” Ian enthused, ignoring him, his eyes
glazing over. “Think of the architecture and the tech and the
culture; what they might look like and how they'd speak; all their
history and what we could learn from them. Hey!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
McLeod had reached over
and plucked the beer bottle from the man's hand. “Explorers have
been up and down the galaxy for decades and haven't found anything
more advanced than bacteria and a few tiny little microscopic
plants,” he said. “So, can the fantasy; You won't be getting your
fat fingers on any hot alien babes!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Not aliens, then?”
Dodds asked of Shy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, something else.
But whatever it is, the Confederation's
getting us all ready to defend ourselves against some great invasion.
Apparently, the Imperium has been completely wiped out, except for a
load of refugees.” From the look on his face, he was being
completely serious.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Who told you that?”
McLeod asked, looking extremely sceptical. “And whoever it was,
tell them to stop smoking so much crack and go get themselves a
girlfriend.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, really. And
something else I heard was that the Navy's
been pumping money into some new top secret project. Some powerful
new weapon, apparently.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds forced himself
not to meet Enrique's or Chaz's eyes, nor say anything, and instead
concentrate on what the men were saying. He could see, out of the
corners of his eyes, that the other two were doing the same.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What project?”
Crew wanted to know.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That's
all I've been told, so it
could be anything,” Shy said with a shrug. “All I know is that
it's costing them an arm and
a leg.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Think they're
building another battleship to replace <I>Dragon</I>?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Shy shook his head.
“Don't know, but
apparently it's the reason
why the orbital ring here hasn't
been finished. They've
diverted all the funding that was meant to go here into that secret
project.” He took a swig of his beer and then pointed his bottle at
Crew. “And since you mention <I>Dragon</I>,
that goes along with the whole thing, too.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“How so?” Dodds
asked, folding up his cards and putting them face down on the table.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Well, <I>Dragon</I>'s
been stolen, right? How do you do that? You can't
just walk on board and take the controls. You'd
need a pretty big force to achieve something like that, and that's
even before you get anywhere near it. You'd
have to either be superhuman, or have someone on the inside.” He
lowered his voice before continuing, leaning a little closer to the
table so that the others could hear. “And Commodore Hawke, right,
how'd he survive? I mean,
it's not like the man would
run off into the escape pods and leave his crew to defend <I>Dragon</I>,
alone. I'm not exactly the
guy's biggest fan, but a
captain goes down with his ship; and you all know that he'd
sooner die on his feet, than curled up in a ball in a pod.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Most likely he was
wounded,” Crew said. “The crew chucked him into the pod and shot
him towards the nearest jumpgate. They needed someone to get away,
and top brass would be more likely to believe a warning coming from
him, than some delirious petty officer.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That doesn't explain
what really went on, though,” Dodds said, somewhat disappointed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Shy shrugged. “No-one
knows exactly what was going on, but from what I've
heard, <I>Dragon</I>
was out somewhere near the Imperial-Independent border. So whatever's
going down is getting closer.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Look, can we stop
with the stupid conspiracy theories, please?” McLeod growled, as
though he was beginning to find his colleague's
words offensive. “There's no secret project, no mass invasion.
Seriously, who's telling you
all this?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hey, I'm
not saying anything else,” Shy said, putting his hands up in
submission. “I heard they killed the last guy who went around
gossiping.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Really?” Enrique
asked, flabbergasted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, they didn't!
Grow up, mate!” McLeod said, as Dodds picked up his beer. It was
becoming obvious that McLeod was feeling the storyteller was now
winding up his audience unnecessarily, and was starting to get bored
with the yarn, seeing its facts being grounded in nothing more than
rumour, speculation and hearsay.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah, they did,”
Shy said. “They shot him when he tried to run away and buried him
in an unmarked grave. Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but they
certainly made him disappear. I think his name was Bishop or Nurse or
Dean or something like that...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds, in the middle of
swigging from his bottle, suddenly choked and spat a mouthful of beer
out onto the floor. He proceeded to cough for a good while, trying to
clear his throat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You okay?” Enrique
asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah, just went down
the wrong way,” Dodds spluttered. Enrique gave him a few slaps on
the back. He noticed how everyone was still giving him a strange look
as he continued wiping his mouth and coughing. “Think that's
true about the Imperium?” Dodds asked Enrique, once he had calmed
down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No idea. What do you
think, Chaz?” Enrique deflected the question to the man sat on the
far right.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I think you boys
should stop worrying and have another drink,” Chaz said with clear
amusement. Dodds became thoughtful. Whilst Shy had been right on one
count, perhaps McLeod did have a point. Maybe the man was
exaggerating to amuse himself. He returned to his cards.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Excuse me?” a
voice interrupted the group, as they prepared to continue their game
once again. They looked up to see a man staring at Enrique, looking
somewhat bemused. A short distance behind him a young woman hovered,
watching the group and the man expectantly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah?” Enrique
asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I er... I hear
you're the guy to talk to
about getting hold of spare mattresses..?”</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle attempted to
convince herself that Dodds and Enrique would cease their whispering
and drop off to sleep. It was not just that they were being loud that
was annoying her, but also that they were doing it after lights out
and everyone else was asleep and quiet. Anything bad that they did
was ultimately a poor reflection on her. She tried to ignore it for a
little longer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The Officer's
Club had been emptied sometime ago, everyone being shepherded back to
their quarters for an immediate lights out. Estelle recalled seeing a
couple of men being shouted at by a higher ranking officer. From what
she had heard, whilst they had been out drinking and enjoying
themselves, they had missed their transport and, as a result, their
scheduled patrol. Though often a calm and pleasant man, Estelle knew
that Meyers would not tolerate that kind of behaviour on the base and
they would without doubt be feeling the heat from him when he
returned. Estelle was not keen for the same fate to befall her or her
team any time soon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Do you think tha guy
wuz right?” Dodds asked, his speech slurring.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Wig guy?” Enrique
wanted to know, communicating with his long-term friend in the same
tongue.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“The guyz that was
talk'en about the Imperial
civil war.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Naah. He's
talking out ta his arse.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
They both went quiet;
Estelle relaxed more. A good minute or so passed. It sounded as
though the conversation that had woken her had been concluded.
Estelle turned over in her bed and rearranged her covers, to get more
comfortable.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah... bu.. but,
when yous thinks about it, its makes sssense,” Dodds tried again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle felt herself
stiffen at the sound of resumed chatter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“How?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Well for one
there's.. there's
that transmission we got t'other
day. That bloke, right, he's was really sscared. I doubt a civil war
could be that bad toos make someone as hysterical as that. He wuz
running away from somethings pretty nasty, I's
thinks,” Dodds managed, the volume of his voice rising as he spoke.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Okay. Anythings
else, like?” Enrique wanted to know, not sounding convinced.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Both men went quiet
again. Even so, Estelle was feeling thoroughly wound up. She hated it
when people would not shut up at night, and even if they did quieten
down now, it could take her quite a while before she was settled and
able to drift off.</P>

Dodds paused to
consider all the possibilities. Despite being drunk, he was not about
to bring up the subject of the ATAFs and the redirection of revenue
into support his argument. He realised, just as he had said it, that
he should not really have mentioned the Dart pilot, either. No, it
didn't matter. He was sure that no-one else was awake to hear him
anyway. He considered telling Enrique about Dean. That was weird that
his name had been brought up tonight. He then remembered the warnings
given him by Admiral Turner and the officer who had come to retrieve
the man's body, and thought
better of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
There was something
there, though, in the back of his
mind. Was there a connection with what he had heard tonight? Dean was
doubtless a piece of the puzzle, but was there something else, too?
Had Dean said something that, at the time, he had missed? The amount
of alcohol he had consumed was inhibiting his ability to think
straight.</P>

“Well, then there's
Hawke,” Estelle heard Dodds' voice offer, resuming after leading
her into false promises that he and Enrique had fallen asleep.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yea, sho?” Enrique
replied to the man in the bunk above him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I swears that since
they pulled him out of that escape pod, he's
become an even bigger arsehole...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Go to sleep, Dodds,”
Estelle said. She'd had enough. The pair had clearly had too much to
drink and were now just spouting random nonsense. At the mention of a
senior officer, and the insults that followed, she had decided that
they had crossed the line. Should anyone come around to inspect their
quarters and discovered them to be speaking after lights out, drunk
and making derogatory remarks about the commodore, they would be
disciplined; all three of them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Dids we wake yous
up, Estelle?” Dodds asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It's
after lights out, Dodds.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Ssorrys, Estelle,

Enrique muttered. “We ain't doin' anys harms, right?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You're
drunk and you're being
loud,” Estelle hissed back at them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Nos louder thans

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I remembers when

from his top bunk. “Hmm, things shange...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah, sshame she
shill shnores likes a pig, though!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Both men started
laughing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I mean it, you two!
Shut up and go to sleep!” Estelle raised her voice. Others around
her stirred a little in their beds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Whatz the problems,
Estelle? Wuz got a late patrol tomorrows,” Dodds said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Or maybe not evens

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah, exactly;

Dodds moaned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“If you don't shut up

you something to do in the morning, Lieutenant!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Jeez,” Dodds said.</P>

“Sssherioushhly dude,

Enrique started.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Final warning,

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She waited patiently
for them both to settle down, feeling her heart thumping hard, her
chest tight. She drifted off to sleep herself, once Dodds and Enrique

Chaz Koonan lay on his
back, arms folded across his chest, staring up at the ceiling. Unlike
Estelle, Dodds and Enrique's conversation had not roused him, as he
had not been asleep. He was thinking, his head filled with memories
of the past and contemplations of the future. He thought of the Dart
pilot; of the conversation in the Officers' Club; and of how Parks
had not kept his word, had not let him go, had broken his promise.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He rolled over and
closed his eyes, knowing that tonight he would not be getting much
sleep. Just like every other night for the past four years.</P>

Grace slept deeply, her slumber aided by the stasis capsule that she
had crawled into over three weeks previous. The escape pod around her
lay in almost complete darkness. Crumbs from biscuits she had eaten
dotted the floor, a small trail leading from a storage cabinet, to
the cockpit chair.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Deep asleep, those last
three weeks had passed unnoticed to her. No longer had she to endure
the frustration and depression she had suffered during the first
seven days alone in the pod. She had wept several times during that
period, almost uncontrollably the whole way through jump space.
Exhausted, she had settled down and slept in the cockpit seat and
had, upon awakening, been greeted by the inky-blackness of space and
her exit from the jump.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Hope and relief had
washed over her as she looked out of the pod, expecting to see
familiar sights of the Independent star system she had entered. Far
below her she sighted a planet, though not one she recognised. That
didn't matter; she was home. A quick glance out the rear viewport
revealed the jumpgate she had exited, the structure not too far
behind her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The navigation systems
of the escape pod synchronized themselves with her new location's
navigation buoys and soon revealed her location: Iliad, an
Independent frontier star system; the planet below her, Diso.
According to the navigation computer, Iliad was sparsely populated,
but populated nonetheless. At that moment, Natalia had exhaled a
breath she seemed to have been holding in for months.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She had activated the
pod's SOS broadcast and then
explored the cramped pod. From a storage cabinet, she had removed a
small bottle of water and a handful of biscuits, before settling back
in the cockpit's seat to
await rescue. And there she had waited. And waited. And waited. But
the minutes had turned to hours, and the hours to days, and in all
that time she saw no signs of rescue. In fact, she saw no signs of
<I>anything</I>.
Not a single glimpse of another vessel, nor any sort of activity
within the system.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She had turned to the
radar system, in an attempt to discover whether there was anything
else around her: perhaps a research station or a ship that may have
failed to spot her, her arrival in Iliad having somehow gone
unnoticed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She would have expected
to have seen a number of coloured shapes, indicating the presence of
other vessels or entities in the area. But except for a solitary
yellow marker resting at the bottom of the display, that she had
already identified as being the jumpgate, it was empty. With the aid
of a flight manual she had discovered, she began tweaking settings
and display options, searching for something, anything, that might
help rid her of the feeling that she was alone. There was nothing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
After the second day
had passed, the relief she had felt upon entering the star system had
all but abandoned her, to be replaced by a feeling of dread. Her
escape pod continued to drift, moving away from Diso and leaving the
jumpgate far behind. She knew what had happened: the system had been
abandoned. She had done her best to hold back the anger and
frustration she had then felt, but it had forced itself out, and she
had hurled the flight manual across the tiny pod's interior, before
cursing out loud and slamming her fists onto the console. Soon after
that, she had begun to weep again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Natalia was unable to
shake the feeling that all her suffering and loss had been for
nothing. Her fate seemed sealed: she would die trapped in this
cramped steel coffin, drifting through space.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
But no, she had come
too far and been through too much to give up hope now. She had looked
behind her to the open stasis capsule that she had used it as a bed.
She deliberated use of the capsule for a while, before turning back
to gaze out at the empty space ahead of her, nibbling on a biscuit
and thinking back over the events of the past months.</P>

Her primary mission had
been a complete success. Along with several other operatives, she had
completed a series of hit-and-run operations against essential Enemy
targets in a number of Imperial systems. The team had gone in hard
and fast, there being no sense in attempting to be strategic about
it. The Enemy were far better equipped, far more knowledgeable and
much more combat efficient than they could ever hope to be. Her unit
had suffered losses along the way, but they all knew that many of
them would not be coming back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Another fundamental
part of the operation had been to collect as much information about
the Enemy and their recent activities as possible. This they had also
achieved, though not without the expense of many lives. The data
cards holding the various reports now resided safe and secure in her
jacket, zipped into an inside pocket.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With their objectives
met and their mission accomplished, they had begun the journey home.
It was as they approached a jumpgate to cross the
Imperial-Independent border that they had been hit hardest. Natalia
had been stood on the small bridge of her vessel when a jump point
had formed behind the convoy. From it had issued an Imperial frigate
and a host of Imperial starfighters, of all variety. They had
attacked the instant they were clear of the point, with ferocious
speed and efficiency.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
One of the convoy had
been destroyed within seconds and several others had been crippled
moments thereafter. Her own ship had been struck by a volley of
rocket fire, sections of the vessel starting to come apart. Fires and
explosions had ripped through the interior, resulting in a great deal
of damage and casualties. The ship had started to tumble, barely a
few kilometres from the gate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As the Enemy left the
vessel, to concentrate on the others who were returning fire and
attempting to clear their paths to reach the jumpgate, Natalia had
pulled the burnt and injured navigator from his chair...</P>

She had survived,
though for how much longer she did not know. After seven days alone
in the Iliad system, the pod's
on-board computer had started to jingle. It had warned her that she
was running low on oxygen and recommended that she place herself
within stasis for the remainder of her journey. Natalia had looked to
the screen and then around to the capsules. It seemed she had little
choice about using them. The SOS continued to broadcast from the
escape pod as it had done for the past seven days, but there was
no-one to hear it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She stood beside the
capsule, staring down into the soft beige padding, which would become
her resting place until she was rescued. A perfectly normal, healthy
human being could survive for months in a capsule such as this, their
metabolism slowed to the point where neither food nor water was
needed to sustain them. Death would eventually claim them, though.
Maybe not for six months, maybe not for twelve, but they would not
live forever. And that was the part about it that had scared Natalia
the most because she didn't know how long her pod might drift for.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As she'd stripped,
Natalia had wondered if the inside of the escape pod would be the
last thing she ever saw. Would she close her eyes, never to awake?
She paused before relenting to the capsule's
control, returning to the cockpit, powering down all the lights and
switching the SOS broadcast to a low range.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She was in two minds
about advertising her presence. On the one hand, it could aid in her
rescue should anyone detect her ship adrift. On the other, the Enemy
could be drawn to it. They would without doubt see the craft on their
radars and come to investigate, but whether they wasted any more time
with it was another matter. She had discovered that the Enemy had
begun to aggressively salvage almost everything they could find in
recent months, gearing up for their next big push. In combat, they
now preferred to cripple their adversaries, so that the vessels could
be assimilated into their ranks; only destroying those that were
either of a measurable threat or completely unusable. This, she knew,
was the only reason she had survived the attack on her convoy: her
vessel meeting their requirements only briefly before it had started
to come apart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Through the
near-darkness, she made her way back to the capsule and settled down
inside, having checked once again that her reports were still secure
in her jacket. With that little peace of mind, she activated the
controls that would close her in and induce the stasis.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
It was Natalia's
belief that switching off most of the power would give the Enemy the
impression that the escape pod had been drifting for years, the power
and vital system components having broken down a long time ago, the
occupants almost certainly dead. She hoped that the pod would prove
too small to be of any use to them, and that they would waste no
further time with it and move on.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Or perhaps they would
destroy it anyway, just to make sure.</P>

“<B STYLE="font-size:1.16em;">D</B>odds!
Hey! Wake up! Wake up!” Dodds blinked awake and became aware of
three things: the first was that Estelle was standing next to his
bunk, shaking him vigorously; the second, that there was an alarm
wailing; and the third, that he had a splitting headache, a result of
the previous night's
drinking session having caught up with him. He wanted nothing more
than to go back to sleep and wake up much later on, when everything
had calmed down, and when it no longer felt as though someone was
tightening a vice around his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He struggled to pull
himself into an upright position, wincing at the pain in his head. He
saw that all around the quarters other people were hastily pulling on
boots, trousers and jackets and running out the door.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What's
happening?” he asked, feeling as though his head was going to
explode at any minute.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Enrique, do <I>not</I>
go back to sleep! Don't you
dare go back to sleep!” Estelle shouted at the man in the bunk
below him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds leaned over,
taking care not to tip himself off the side of the bed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hey, come on!”
Estelle called again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“All right, don't
shout, I heard you first time,” Enrique complained. He hauled
himself back up, where he sat hunched over, head in his hands. “Aw,
man. I feel like I'm going to puke.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds pulled out a
watch that he kept under his pillow and tried to focus on the little
blue figures on the face. It was just after four in the morning; he
hadn't managed more than three hours'
sleep since settling down. He felt a momentary sense of déjà vu.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What's
going on?” Dodds asked again. His eyes followed the figures running
out of the room and then saw the answer to his question come striding
in through the quarters' doorway, flanked by two other staff.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Commodore Hawke
surveyed the scene in front of him with a look of disgust. “Come
on! Come one! Get moving!” he barked, clapping his hands together.
“You hear that alarm? That's
the call to general quarters! That means now! What are you standing
around for? Move! Now!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle turned back to
Dodds and mouthed for him to <I>get
up now!</I> Dodds looked to Hawke and saw his attention shift
to the bunk he and Enrique occupied.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Hawke's eyes narrowed
as they fell upon Estelle. “What the hell are you doing? Did I not
just make myself clear? Have you gone deaf?” Hawke asked of her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Even in his current
state, Dodds knew that Estelle was in the one place she would rather
not be at this point in time: stood next to two members of her flight
group, who did not seem capable of mustering the strength to pull
themselves out from under the covers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sir, I was...”
Estelle began.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Do these little boys
need their mummy to dress them?” Hawke growled. He then looked
straight at Dodds and the pilot felt his heart jump the moment the
flicker of recognition crossed Hawke's face. “Dodds! I should have
known! How could it <I>possibly</I>
have been anyone else? Didn't
feel like getting out of bed this morning? Decided you were going to
call in sick?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle gave Dodds a
pleading look not to answer back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, sir. I just had
difficulties sleeping last night, sir,” Dodds said, forcing himself
to answer in as much as a normal tone as he could muster.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Well then, we'll
see if we can get you a cot and a teddy bear for tonight then, shall
we? Now get your arse out of bed!” Hawke shot back with contempt.
With one last look around the dormitory, he turned on his heel and
started back down the corridor. But not before issuing an ultimatum:
“Main briefing room, Dodds!” he said, pointing a stiff finger.
“Three minutes!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As he stormed out of
the room, Estelle began throwing Dodds' and Enrique's clothing at
them, urging them to get a move on. Kelly and Chaz, already clothed,
hovered close by, waiting for the two men to dress themselves. They
did so as fast as they could and together the five hurried from the
now empty dormitory, towards the building holding the main briefing
hall.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">

<P CLASS="western">
The <I>White
Knights</I> entered the packed hall to discover that
all of the seating, except for that closest to the podium, had
already been taken. Dodds wanted to remain at the back, out of sight,
happy to join others sat down on the floor, against the wall, but
Estelle was already herding them to the front. The group ended up
sitting almost right in front of the podium, just where Dodds and
Enrique did not wish to be. The platform was occupied already by
Parks, standing against a large screen that covered half of the front
wall.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks watched with an
impatient scowl as people continued to stream into the briefing hall.
“Find a seat or some place to stand and settle down!” his voice
boomed over the speakers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Hawke shoved his way
past those standing, to get to the front, followed a lot less
aggressively by Meyers. Dodds caught a glimpse of Hawke stuffing a
handkerchief back into an inside jacket pocket and saw that it was
once again stained with blood. He wondered in his hazy mind what was
causing the man to receive so many nosebleeds. He could never
remember him having done so much in the past.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks said, “We have
a lot to get through and very little time to do it, so pay attention,
all of you.” The voices died down and all that remained were the
sounds of the shuffling of chairs and obligatory coughing. Now that
he had everyone's full
attention, Parks began in full.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You should all know
that several months ago the Confederation Stellar Navy flagship, <I>CSN
Dragon</I>, was boarded and subsequently stolen by an
unidentifiable, but strongly numbered and armed, hostile force.
Following the take over, it dropped off of all galactic surveillance
systems and vanished without a trace.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Behind Parks, the
screen showed images of the enormous battleship; not that anyone who
had every set eyes on the behemoth needed reminding. At over
four-and-a-half-kilometres in length, it dwarfed even the
Confederation's own
carriers, being several times bigger than its nearest rival. <I>Griffin</I>,
the largest of the CSN's
carriers, was a mere eleven hundred and thirty meters by comparison.
As Parks continued to speak, the images on the screen behind him
changed to show schematics of the battleship, along with size
comparisons with other large vessels. Dodds rubbed his eyes, trying
to focus and keep them open.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Without going into
specifics, we now believe the theft to have been the work of one of
the major factions fighting in the Imperial civil war. After <I>Dragon</I>
disappeared it was assumed it had either been destroyed or had been
abandoned and left to drift somewhere between star systems. However,
two days ago <I>Dragon</I>
reappeared in the independent-declared regions of space and has begun
making its way through some of the uninhabited systems there. We have
been tracking its progress and believe that we are now in a position
to intercept and retake the ship.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Murmurs and mumbling
began around the room.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“He's
got to be kidding,” Dodds heard Kelly say under her breath. She was
staring up at the screen, looking staggered by the news. Dodds
recalled the first time he had met Kelly, back at flight school, and
how one of the first things she had spoken to him about was <I>Dragon</I>.
Kelly, out of all the cadets there, was the only one to have ever
laid eyes on it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She had told him of how
she had been overwhelmed by <I>Dragon</I>'s
sheer size, in comparison with all the other battleships in the
Confederation's fleet. Prior
to her joining the Navy, her father had managed to pull a few strings
and arranged for her to be given a tour of some of the CSN's
bases and major battleships; <I>Dragon</I>
included. The ship was in dry dock at the time, undergoing
maintenance. Kelly had found the sight astounding and had gushed
about it for days. At the time Kelly, had remarked that it looked
quite menacing and that she was glad it was on “their side”.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The ship's
body was like that of a knife blade, with only the merest stub of a
hilt at the rear, housing three massive engines, complimented by four
smaller ones on either side. The main body of the vessel drove
forward to a point, two pairs of protrusions in the middle and at the
rear following the overall outline of its form. There were no major
vertical structures anywhere along its length - only a small number
of elevations present to accommodate the bridge and incredible array
of armaments that dotted the surface.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
And though it was now
just an image projected onto a screen, Dodds could see that the sheer
magnitude of ship still staggered her today. The same sense of awe
was not to be found in Dodds, however. Despite the enormity of the
news, he found it difficult to be either impressed or interested as
he looked up at the screen. He looked at Enrique, who was fighting to
keep his eyes open. Clearly, like himself, the man was wishing he
could be somewhere else.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>You've
really messed up this time, Simon</I>, he thought to himself.
<I>You've come back to try and
set things right, but when it comes to something bloody important
you're almost incapacitated. Congratulations, idiot.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He slid down a little
into his seat, to get more comfortable. Estelle nudged him to sit up.
In future, he'd have to make a better effort not to sit next to her
during things like this.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Pipe down!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The sound of Parks'
irritated voice was quick to disperse the mumbling that had started.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Based on the
intelligence we have gathered, we anticipate that <I>Dragon</I>
will very soon be entering the Aster system, within an uninhabited
region of Independent space. Once there, it will be met by a large
contingent of allied forces, who will immediately commence <I>Operation
Menelaus</I>.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The screen behind Parks
changed once more, to show an overview of the operation he had just
named, listing all involved parties and overall strategy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“The reappearance of
<I>Dragon</I>
within the independent regions of space has raised many concerns
within the Independent World Council. The Confederation has been
working closely with the UNF over the past forty-eight hours and they
are fully prepared to back our move to retake <I>Dragon</I>.
They will be laying on support of two carriers and a number of
starfighters, themselves. The main strike force will consist of
<I>Griffin</I>,
<I>Ifrit
</I>and
<I>Leviathan</I>,
captained by myself, Commodore Hawke and Captain Meyers
respectively.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“This is getting
pretty serious,” Estelle whispered in Dodds' ear. “They're
throwing a lot of weight behind this, sending up <I>Griffin</I>,
<I>Ifrit</I>
<I>and</I> <I>Leviathan</I>.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds
wished he could share her admiration. He also wished he had not
helped to polish off the rest of that whiskey bottle. He
pulled back away from Estelle, putting a hand on his forehead. It,
like most of the rest of him, was feeling rather hot. He then found
himself wishing his hand was a pack of ice. There, that was his
three; and none of them had come true.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds
turned a lazy head around the briefing room to
see that, in an almost exact repeat of the ATAF presentation the
<I>Knights</I>
had attended earlier that year, jaws were hanging down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Do not
misunderstand,” Parks boomed over the returning mumblings.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds winced.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“As I'm
sure all of you can fully appreciate, <I>Dragon</I>
by itself in a combat situation would prove a very formidable
opponent; and on this occasion we believe it to also be accompanied
by two Imperial frigates and several starfighter squadrons, all of
which will have to be handled and dispatched in order to successfully
complete the operation. For this purpose, we will be employing the
use of several fighter squadrons of our own.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The screen behind him
changed once again, to display a representation of the fighters,
grouped into squadrons. Numbers of participating types were listed
next to the flat two-dimensional images. There were four classes
there: TAFs, Rays, Rooks, and Hammerheads. It looked as though there
were three digits next to the TAFs and two for the others, but Dodds
could not focus on the exact numbers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Now listen
carefully,” Parks' voice
continued over the hall speakers. “There are two primary objectives
in this mission: the first, as already stated, is the successful
recovery and safe return of <I>Dragon</I>.
The second is the apprehension of these two men...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The screen behind Parks
changed again, displaying the two men in question. Both wore full
Imperial naval dress and faced the camera head-on. Neither man wore a
cap in the pictures, though both were highly decorated.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“The first, and most
important of these two, is Admiral Zackaria. He is the Fleet Admiral
of the Imperial Naval Forces and is, without a shadow of a doubt, the
one person whom we cannot afford to lose. I would even go as far as
to say that the capture of this man actually <I>outweighs</I>
the recapture of <I>Dragon</I>
itself. We believe that he may have been instrumental in the theft of
<I>Dragon</I>
in the first instance and is likely to also be playing a key role in
the on-going troubles throughout the Imperium. Should he be aboard
<I>Dragon</I>
then he must not, under any circumstances, be allowed to be killed. I
say again: <I>we need this man
alive</I>.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Enrique...” Dodds
heard Estelle hiss. He looked around to see Enrique sitting back up
from where he had been hunched over, hiccuping. Dodds couldn't be
sure whether either of the three men stood on the stage were aware of
the issues he was experiencing trying to focus – certainly Hawke
would already have an idea – but he thought he'd better make the
effort. He folded his arms and looked at the screen, finding the
black thread, red trims and silver buttons of the Imperial uniforms a
little easier on his eyes, than the bright white glare of the
previous screens.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He looked first to
Admiral Zackaria, a name that was a little more familiar to him than
the other; he had heard it thrown around from time to time over the
years, though not certain he would be able to pick the man out of a
line-up. The man looked to be in his early-to-mid sixties, his hair
more or less gone, leaving him with strands of grey. His eyes, too,
were grey and possessed a hardened edge. His face was long and clean
shaven, but his skin appeared rough, with wrinkles, tiny scars and
marks scattered about. Easy enough, Dodds concluded. His age would
make him quite distinctive amongst everyone else and he would be a
lot easier to tackle than most. Not that Dodds wanted to get involved
right now.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“The second is
Commodore Rissard,” Parks went on. “To our knowledge, he is
Zackaria's second-in-command
and right-hand man. He does not hold as much sway as Zackaria
himself, but it would be in our interest to bring this man in, too.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Rissard did not appear
as old as Zackaria, closer in age to Parks and Hawke. Like Zackaria,
he was light-skinned, but with short, thick blonde spiky hair.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Look at his eyes,”
Estelle said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds did: they were
unnaturally bright blue, almost as if they were some kind of implant;
though maybe they were just contact lenses.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I don't like the
look of him,” Kelly murmured.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Though he held a
neutral expression, Dodds did acknowledge that the man looked
menacing; threatening; almost sadistic. Maybe it was those eyes. A
slideshow of images began, displaying the two men in various other
poses: some at formal gatherings, others within parades. In a few,
Zackaria could be seen with a ceremonial sword at his hip, and
sometimes holding it in a rather regal fashion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
His head began to ache
once more. He eyed Chaz, seeing the big man looking up the screen. He
looked both very attentive and as fresh as a daisy. How? He'd been
drinking too, hadn't he? He'd also enjoyed his fair share of the
whiskey, as far as Dodds could remember. He wondered how the other
four were feeling this morning. He expected that McLeod's head was in
a comparable state to his own.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Remember these
faces, people,” Parks said. “I want to be assured that even those
not directly involved in the boarding of <I>Dragon</I>
are familiar with all targets and objectives of this operation.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He then moved on to
describe how the operation was to progress. Dodds let his attention
slip a little, but listened as best he could through his suffering.
As far as he could tell it was to unfold this way: the Hammerheads,
together with support from TAFs and Rays, would lead the Initial Run
against the two escorting frigates. Together they would knock the
frigates out of action, as well as any starfighter support. Once the
path was clear to <I>Dragon</I>,
the Confederation would deliver their coup de grâce: as with all
newer capital ships, <I>Dragon</I>
had an inbuilt security module, that allowed for all
non-essential-to-life functions to be shut down remotely. The idea
had been scoffed at by <I>Dragon</I>'s
design committee when the chief engineer had proposed it. He had gone
ahead and implemented it regardless, arguing that it might come in
very useful one day. And so it now proved.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With <I>Dragon</I>
disabled, the escorting frigates out of action or destroyed, and only
a handful of enemy starfighters to deal with, the rest of the mission
would be a cakewalk. A large number of boarding vessels would attach
themselves to <I>Dragon</I>'s
hull, before burning their way inside and flooding the entire ship
with toxic gas. Following this, joint Confederation and Independent
World teams would board <I>Dragon</I>
and perform a mop-up of any remaining enemy forces, before handing
over control to Parks, Hawke or Meyers. Zackaria and Rissard would be
located and taken aboard a specially appointed shuttle, where medical
teams would administer treatments as required.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Should the security
code fail to work, then the combined CSN and UNF teams would attempt
to force boarding by firepower alone. Although this was far from
ideal, the allied forces would at least still retain the element of
surprise and again seek to take down the frigates, before engaging
the massive battleship itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Or something like that
anyway...</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Dodds!” It was
Estelle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds realised that he
had slumped down into his seat. His chin was on his chest and his
eyes were closed. He was on the verge of falling asleep. He opened
his eyes and looked back up at the screen, to see what he might have
missed. Parks was looking right at him. The commodore paused for a
brief moment, before starting to talk again. He then stopped,
pressing a button on the podium that killed the microphone and looked
at Hawke, who had gained his attention. Following the very brief
exchange, he brought the microphone back up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Time is short,
people. If we are to make our appointment, we need to get things
underway. You will be further briefed on the strategy upon arrival at
your designated carriers.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The screen behind him
changed to detail a list of assigned flight teams to carriers. Parks
began to rattle off the names of the flight groups as, behind him,
Meyers and Hawke got to their feet and made for the exit. The
assembled personnel sat staring up at the screen, waiting for him to
finish.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What are you all
sitting there for?” Parks asked in sudden anger. “At least a
quarter of you should be at your departure points, waiting for
transports. Come on people! Suit up and get moving! Now!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The fliers jumped to
their feet as ordered and made to leave, whilst the commodore
continued to read out names, departure points and destinations. The
<I>White
Knights</I> had been assigned to <I>Griffin</I>
and the vast squadron making up the Initial Run, meaning they would
be responsible for protecting the bombers as they engaged the
Imperial frigates, as well as clearing the way for the boarding
parties.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Right, let's go
people,” Estelle said, standing up and preparing to lead the team
out of the briefing room and prep for departure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You all right, man?”
Dodds asked of Enrique. The man's eyes were reddened from where he
had been vigorously rubbing them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Aw, mate, I feel
like death warmed up...” Enrique started.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You two - come
here!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds turned around to
see Parks glaring straight at him. The delegation over, Parks had
turned his attention to a new issue: that of Dodds and Enrique. He
clenched his fist, as if grabbing them by their jackets and pulling
them towards him. Dodds had feared this from the moment he had almost
drifted off. Seated right before the commodore, it looked as if he
and Enrique's various sick expressions and attempts not to fall
asleep had not gone unnoticed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Enrique and Dodds stood
themselves in front of Parks as requested, though neither of them
saluted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks looked over the
two men. “What seems to be the diffic...” he started, before
wrinkling his nose. “Are you two <I>drunk</I>?”
The commodore did not need to finish the sentence, nor less ask the
question; the stench of alcohol emanating from the two men already
provided all the answers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, sir, we...”
Dodds began, knowing that the very breath leaving his mouth would
make it all too clear that he was either rather inebriated or
suffering from a severe hangover.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Shut your mouth,
Lieutenant!” Parks snarled. He looked over at the men and women
retreating out the briefing room, seeking a quick solution to his new
problem. “Lieutenant Chang!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sir,” the man
Parks had called after turned around and saluted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You're
being reassigned. You and your team will now be a part of the Initial
Run. The <I>White
Knights</I> will take over your secondary cover
duties.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir,” Chang's
face lit up. It was clear that he was delighted that he would now be
doing an important job, instead of providing menial cover for the
Confederation's capital
ships. Should everything go well, then he and his team would be
recognised for the essential role they would play, and perhaps even
rewarded for their hard work after a successful operation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds looked to
Estelle, about to apologise, when Parks pushed past him, getting to
her first. She stood to attention as the commodore approached.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Get your boys
sobered up, de Winter!” Parks glared, wagging a finger in her face.
“And get to that departure point <I>n</I><I>ow</I>!
I don't want any more screw
ups!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir!
Immediately, sir...” Estelle started, though Parks was already
marching past her and out the briefing room.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">

“... pair of complete
bloody idiots!” Estelle glared at Enrique and Dodds as they hurried
down the corridors to the transport landing zones, helmets in hand,
still fastening up their flight suits. “Make sure you get into
those damn shuttles!” she added as the throng of people threatened
to separate them from one another.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle was both bitter
and broken. For
the second time in just a few weeks she had been busted down,
absolved of any responsibility, of any chance to prove herself of her
true worth. It was starting to become too much of a regular
occurrence for her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The cool, crisp air of
the early morning hit her as she left the housing block, along with
the crowd. It was just past sunrise and spotlights illuminated her
path, aiding the dim natural light. Ahead of her, she could see the
multicoloured marking lights of landing platforms, flickering in her
view as they were obscured by other people rushing in front of her.
It was a clear morning and the arc of lights dotted around the
incomplete orbital ring could be seen high in the sky. Not that this
was the time to admire such things.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As she approached the
landing zones, Estelle was greeted by a scene that she had only seen
in archived war footage: in the sky ahead of her, several transport
shuttles were accelerating upwards towards the atmosphere, carrying
their full complement of personnel. Pairs of strong blue engine light
could be seen higher up as the transports attained the speeds
necessary to achieve escape velocity, leaving subtle trails of cyan
as they went. A couple of dozen transport craft rested on landing
pads, hatches open, personnel being crammed inside. Hovering in the
sky above were more transports, waiting for landing pads to become
free, so they could touch down and pick up more passengers. If the
presentation had failed to impress upon anyone the importance of the
operation they were about to undertake, then what Estelle was
witnessing now would surely do the trick.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She had long since lost
Dodds and Enrique, and looked around for them as she drew closer to
their designated landing zone. She then spotted a big, dark-skinned
man ahead of her, running to a transport as people were called
forward by one of the many air marshals present. Relief washed over
her as she recognised Chaz, and then Enrique and Dodds, following
just a short way behind him. The three, along with several others,
got into the transport, which was quick to seal its doors and
takeoff, another transport quick to take its place.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With her boys well on
their way, Estelle looked around for Kelly. Where was she? Like
herself, Kelly was barely taller than average height and in amongst
the taller men and women it was going to be hard to spot her. Estelle
felt herself being pushed forward and glancing around, she found that
Kelly was just behind her. The woman was looking more than a little
concerned as she was jostled back and forth, and Estelle reached her
hand back to hold on to her. Not only to make sure her friend was
okay, but to ensure that her team made it onto <I>Griffin</I>
without any problems. She could not afford yet another black mark
against her name. Even after the heart-to-heart she'd had with Kelly
the previous evening, Estelle found it hard not to put her
aspirations ahead of her friends, a fact that had now been further
compounded by Enrique and Dodds'
irresponsible drinking.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle took a firm
hold of Kelly's hand as the
throng pushed her forward. Ahead of her, a transport had filled its
quota of passengers and was setting off. Now at the front of the
crowd, Kelly and Estelle were next.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You all right,
Kelly?” Estelle looked around and asked of her friend. Kelly looked
scared for some reason. “We do this all the time. Just remain
calm.” Estelle attempted to reassure her that the shuttle ride was
nothing to get concerned about.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“This time it just
feels more real,” Kelly said. “We're not going on patrol this
time; we're going on the offensive.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“They have it fully
planned out,” Estelle said, keeping an eye on the transport that
was descending from the sky. “The CSN always makes the safety of
those in service its top priority.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Even before <I>Dragon</I>,
Zackaria and Rissard?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Even before <I>Dragon</I>,
Zackaria and Rissard.” Estelle shook the follow-up sentence
from her head. There was always a first time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The transport landed
and an air marshal beckoned them forward. Estelle lost her grip on
Kelly's hand as everyone
surged forward. Parks'
speech must have hit home with many.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, only you guys!”
the air marshal said, spreading his arms out and trying to get a
control of the crowd. “You lot head over to that one. The rest of
you get back. I only want twelve for this one.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Looking around, Estelle
discovered she had been separated from Kelly and felt uncomfortable
not knowing where everyone was. She tried to rejoin the main group of
waiting people.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hey, where you going
there?” the marshal stopped her from leaving. “No time to go back
now. In you get.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The man's
hand was on her back, pushing her on-board the transport. Now inside,
the hatch closed and locked, leaving Estelle to wonder if Kelly had
made it. She felt the engines engage and took up a position on the
bench, pulling down the familiar restraining harness over her
shoulders. The shuttle was smaller than the ones she had grown used
to over the past few weeks and held fewer people. Space on <I>Griffin</I>
would be at a premium, when compared to Spirit Orbital. Estelle
glanced around at the others occupying the transport, at first not
recognising any of the faces. She then did a double take.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Andrea?” she asked
in complete surprise.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The curly,
blonde-haired member of the <I>Red
Devils</I> looked over in the direction of the voice
and smiled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Estelle!” Andrea
said, eyes sparkling. “How have you been?” She looked genuinely
pleased to see her.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle was stunned at
how chipper Andrea was at such a time. “I've
been good. Everything's
going very well,” Estelle answered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>Andrea's
here? At Mandelah</I><I>?
Since when?</I> Estelle wondered to herself. <I>Does
this mean that the </I>Red Devils<I>
didn</I><I>'</I><I>t
succeed in the evaluation, either? Did it go to the other team?</I>
She forgot their name.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Are you based here?
I've not seen you around,”
Estelle asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No,” Andrea said,
shaking her head, her curly locks bumping against her face. “I've
been continuing the training and been posted in a number of places.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
That confirmed it.
Andrea's team had won.
Estelle realised her face was betraying her sense of jealousy. She
decided not to ask any more about how the training was going; about
how Andrea was getting on flying a starfighter that she should have
been; about how praise was being piled on her, for her great work.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She did want to know
one thing though: “So, what are you doing here?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Special operations,”
Andrea replied with a knowingly confident wink and a smile.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle had heard
enough. She sat back and closed her eyes, waiting for the transport
to arrive at it's
destination.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">

<P CLASS="western">
Dodds, Enrique and Chaz
stood on the flight deck of <I>Griffin</I>,
bunched up with several other personnel and crew members, that had
disembarked from the transport shuttles. The deck of the carrier was
massive, spanning close to the entire width of the vessel itself. The
adjoining launch catapult ran almost a third of the ship's
length, the half-octagon-shaped tunnel lit at regular intervals as it
stretched off towards open space.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The junior OOD
instructed the new arrivals to await Parks. As the numbers began to
swell, the three men were joined by Estelle, and then Kelly. Dodds
witnessed a brief exchange between the two and guessed that Estelle
was busying herself keeping her team together and focused. His eyes
flickered over the gathering of personnel and he noticed a tall woman
with curly blonde hair being led away from the main assembled group.
Had he seen her somewhere before? His eyes followed her for a moment,
before he noticed Parks approaching. The assembled group stood to
attention and saluted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Welcome to the <I>CSN
Griffin</I>, boys and girls,” Parks addressed them as
transports continued to arrive and unload their passengers. “The
ship you are standing on is currently acting as the CSN's
flagship, in <I>Dragon'</I>s
soon to be ended absence. This is <I>my</I>
ship and I expect you to remember that at all times. You should feel
both honoured and privileged to have been given the opportunity to
serve aboard this vessel.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds felt the man's
gaze come in his and Enrique's direction as he spoke the last two
sentences. He watched the commodore as he began pacing in a small
area, hands behind his back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks went on, “As
soon as we are up to our full complement, we will jump to the Aster
system, where we will rendezvous with the UNF's
charmingly named twin carriers, <I>Grendel</I>
and <I>Grendel</I><I>'</I><I>s
Mother</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“From there, we will
await the arrival of <I>Dragon</I>
and then immediately commence <I>Operation
Menelaus</I>. Primary defence and Initial Run teams
should be prepared to depart the moment we arrive at our destination.
Secondary defence teams,” - his eyes once again flicked in the
direction of the <I>White
Knights</I> - “should await further instructions.
Squadron leaders will be briefed further before our arrival.
Additionally, a full breakfast is being prepared for all serving
crew, so there is no need to worry about going into this on an empty
stomach. For now, prepare yourselves for jump.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With his introduction
and points made, Parks departed the flight deck, and the attendants
began clearing personnel as part of the jump preparations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Have you ever seen
<I>Dragon</I>
in real life?” Enrique asked Dodds as they were escorted to
<I>Griffin</I>'s
crew quarters.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Not in real life,
only video footage.” Dodds said. “The only thing I know about it
is that it's big and has a
lot of guns.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I've
seen it,” Kelly piped up, trotting up alongside the pair, in an
attempt to keep up with the long strides the two men were making to
match speed with the officer leading the way. “And yes, it's
big. My father arranged for me to be given a flyby before I joined
up.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, we know,
Kelly,” Dodds said, putting a hand up to his temple. “You've told
us about a million and one times.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Mate, don't bite her
head off,” Enrique jumped in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds looked at Kelly,
seeing her a little incensed by his comment. “Sorry, Kelly. My
bloody head is killing me. That shuttle ride didn't help at all.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It's your own
fault,” Kelly said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, I know,”
Dodds said. “Okay, so, anything else you can tell us about <I>Dragon</I>?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No,” Kelly shook
her head. “Nothing that you don't already know.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I hope we'll
be given a bit more information other than “it's
big”, before we get to Aster and have to face off against it,”
Estelle complained. “A basic strategy would be a good start.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“If you're talking
basics, then how about that <I>Dragon</I>
has a maximum crew complement of just under fifty thousand, including
starfighter pilots,” a man's
voice stated. “And that it can also comfortably accommodate over a
thousand fighters in its hangars, without any concessions for type.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Heads spun around,
stunned to discover that Chaz was the one offering up the
information.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds caught Estelle's
eye, before she looked back at the big man. “What about its
weaponry? Defences?” she asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Numerous enhanced
plasma and laser turrets and batteries,” Chaz said. “And the
entire ship is protected by multiple high-powered shield generators;
far more efficient than a carrier's or a frigate's.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Still wishing you'd
asked?” Kelly said to Estelle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle ignored Kelly
and pressed for more information. “What else?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It's secondary
offensive armament consists of eight plasma accelerators,” Chaz
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle almost stopped
walking. “<I>Eight</I>
accelerators?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz nodded. “Three
on the port and starboard, two on the bow.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds and Enrique swore
simultaneously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz added, “I'd
suggest that if you're going
to attack that thing you should aim to do it from the maximum
possible distance, to counter its defensive capabilities; and unless
you can apply sheer strength of numbers, attempting to take it on
with starfighters alone would prove next to impossible.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The other four <I>Knights</I>
exchanged disquieted looks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“How many fighters
are we talking?” Enrique wanted to know.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“More than we're
taking,” Chaz answered, almost inaudibly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
They had arrived at the
quarters where they would be spending the next few hours, whilst
<I>Griffin</I>
made the jump to Aster.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“How do you know all
this?” Estelle asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Let's
just say a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, Lieutenant,” Chaz
said, pulling himself up onto a nearby bunk and lying back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds spied one of
quarters' beds past the others and made for it, slumping down onto
the mattress. It was far from the most comfortable thing he had ever
sat on – even the beds at Spirit offered more – but right now, it
met his needs. He sat for a moment, before stretching out across its
length and closing his eyes, grateful that he could start on
recuperating. What he really needed now was to get his hands on some
painkillers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I can see why it
would be best to disable it before we attempt to retake it now,”
Kelly commented, settling down at the foot of a bed that Enrique had
also taken to.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Wait,” Estelle
said. “You said the accelerators were it's <I>secondary</I>
defence system.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I did,” Chaz said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“So, what's its
first?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“An anti-matter
cannon. Only vessel in existence to be kitted out with one.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Oh. I'd forgotten
about that,” Kelly said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It's got a <I>what</I>?”
Enrique said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>Dragon</I>'s
main offensive weapon is a high-powered cannon, that is capable of
directing a concentration of anti-matter at any frontal target,”
Chaz said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What exactly does
that mean?” Estelle asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Though Dodds had his
eyes closed, he could tell that for all Estelle's knowledge of the
ins and outs of Naval protocol, Chaz was now speaking a language that
even she did not understand.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It means it can
destroy anything in its path,” Kelly explained. “It is powerful
enough to even take down Spirit Orbital with a single shot. We don't
want to be in the way of that if it happens to get a chance to use
it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
A handful of other
pilots had been assigned to the same quarters as the <I>Knights</I>
and people began to chatter, discussing what Chaz had said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“So whilst we're
all telling stories, does someone want to tell me what's
so special about this Zackaria guy that Parks wants so badly?” a
man's voice said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“He's
the current Fleet Admiral of the Imperial Senate's
naval forces,” a voice spoke up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds thought he
recognised it, and tilted his head to look over to see if it was the
same fountain of knowledge from the previous night; the one that had
been spreading rumours and speculation at their card game. It turned
out it wasn't, but the conversation did perk Dodds'
interest somewhat. Even so, whilst the others, with the usual
exception of Chaz, turned to give their attention to the speaker,
Dodds was happy to lie back and listen where he was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, I know he's
the admiral of the fleet,” the first man said. “I was awake for
that part of the briefing.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Right, so how much
do you know about the civil war?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Well, there's a lot
of a dead people as a result. As well as a huge influx of asylum
seekers and illegal immigrants, that I'm having to prop up with my
taxes.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Apart from that.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Nothing.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Not how it started
or who's involved or
anything?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“The Senate and the
Emperor, wasn't it? Actually no, nothing,” the first man said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
A few other answers of
<I>no</I> followed thereafter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“All right, well,
basically there are two main sides in the Imperial civil war: those
fighting for the Imperial Senate and those fighting for Emperor
Lorenzo III,” the storyteller started. “The civil war began when
the Senate disagreed with the Emperor's
decision to grant independence to two Imperial star systems, and
having another three under consideration. The Emperor was extremely
popular with his people for things like that, as well as improving
relationships with other Independent worlds and the Confederation.
You probably already know that until recently the Imperium was very
prosperous and actually envied throughout the galaxy.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No,” the first man
scoffed. “Can't say I've
really ever cared. What happens over there is their problem, not
mine.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Stop interrupting
and let him finish. No, really, shut up! That's an order,” Estelle
said. There was a pause. Dodds glanced over to see Estelle glaring at
a man. For once, he was glad to hear Estelle pulling rank. Political
yarns tended to bore him, but this one was intriguing enough to make
him want to hear what had happened.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle looked back to
the storyteller, a thin, lanky-looking man, with a bowl haircut. He
closed his eyes as she said, “Go on, what happened? Who was the
instigator?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Most believe it was
the Senate,” the storyteller resumed. “One day, the Senate, led
by the senior magistrate, upped and left, setting up house in an
Imperial star system that held a majority interest in the Senate's
position, and was as far away from the Emperor's
Seat as they could get. They felt that the Emperor's
actions were a threat to the continued prosperity of the Imperium and
that the Emperor could one day bring about the collapse of the
Empire. They said it was becoming too diluted and the constant
undermining of the core strengths would make it appear to be growing
weak to the Independent worlds and the Confederacy. At the time, the
Senate was backed by something like ten percent of the Imperium.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Ten percent? That's
not a lot,” a woman interrupted the speaker. “That's
like those minority parties you get, the fascists and the ones
obsessed with trivial matters. I mean what exactly did they plan to
do?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hold on, I'm
getting there,” the storyteller said. “Ten percent is still quite
a lot when you think about it: it's several hundred million people at
least. And with those behind them, they attacked all the worlds that
had split from the Empire and then attempted to assassinate the
Emperor himself.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Wow.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah, but they
failed. And the Emperor, as was his nature, invited them to an open
dialogue to resolve the issues between the two. The Senate refused
and then attempted to assassinate him again. The second time they
were a little more successful, although they didn't
actually manage to kill him. The assassin ended up killing the
Emperor's wife and injuring
the Emperor very badly, before he himself was killed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds opened his eyes
to see all attention was on the speaker, listening to what he had to
say. Although the information he was providing to them could have
been garnered by anyone who had taken the time to follow the news
over the last few years, to many in the room this was new
information; hot off the presses. Some others, outside the quarters,
had stopped on their way past, hovering in the doorway to listen in
to what the man had to say.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The storyteller
continued, “Following that attempt on his life, the Emperor didn't
hold back and launched a full scale assault on the Senate, deploying
a massive strike force to the systems they had moved to. They
completely overwhelmed the forces the Senate had mustered to defend
themselves, but the Emperor fell short of wiping them out completely.
He gave them one last chance to yield, rejoin the Empire and accept
his rule, rather than completely destroying them. And for a time it
appeared that they were preparing to do so, but then one day...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sorry,” the first
man cut in, sounded already bored with the history lesson. “But
what exactly does this have to do with this Admiral Zackaria?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Admiral Zackaria was
the fleet admiral for the Imperial Naval Forces; he worked for the
Emperor. But he defected to side with the Imperial Senate, and around
five years ago they fought back harder than ever before and started
to win the war.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“How?” Estelle
asked. “You said that only a small fraction of the Imperium
supported the Senate. How could they be winning? They were
outnumbered to begin with, and after what you said about the Senate's
supporting systems being almost destroyed, I don't
see how that's possible?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Well, I don't
know either,” the storyteller said. “But that's
why the Confederacy want him. Because whatever he's
up to is starting to affect the Confederation's
own interests. He's
apparently already orchestrated the theft of a Python-class
battleship, and I don't
think anyone really wants to stand around and watch to see what he
does next.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I don't see the
point,” the man whom Estelle had shouted at said. “Why even
bother bringing him in? What they should just do is put a bullet in
his head the minute they find him. That's what I'd do. Bang! Would
solve the problem straight away.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“He'll probably
already be dead by the time they get to him,” a woman chipped in,
“since they're planning on flooding <I>Dragon</I>
with nerve agent or whatever it is.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“The whole place'll
look like Hentose, back in 2612, after they're done with it,”
another commented.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hentose?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah, that
underground station that had the accident with the bio-engineered
stuff. Everyone's skin was practically melted off when they found
'em. I think one poor guy was still alive. He was a right mess.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Good luck
identifying Zackaria if that happens.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Whatever they want
that guy for, I hope it's worth it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The quarter's
musings were put on hold as Parks'
voice came over <I>Griffin</I>'s
intercoms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“All crew, this is
your captain speaking. Prepare for jump.”</P>

Parks strode down the
long, central aisle of <I>Griffin</I>'s
bridge, and up to the front to check on how the departure
preparations were progressing. Around him, crew busied themselves,
performing last-minute checks to ensure that their route was clear
and all essential safety measures had been followed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Just ahead of him, seen
out the frontal viewport, the last few transport craft could be seen
departing <I>Ifrit</I>
and <I>Leviathan</I>,
and making their way either back to Spirit Orbital or returning to
the planet surface. Many other supply craft were leaving the carriers
with each passing second, their cargo of essential equipment and
armaments having been offloaded. <I>Ifrit</I>
and <I>Leviathan</I>
rested on either side of the lead carrier, <I>Griffin</I>
being granted flagship status, if only due to its larger size,
armaments, and crew complement.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>This
is it,</I> Parks thought to himself. <I>This
is where I find out whether I</I><I>'</I><I>m
ready</I>. He held back on thinking the next few hours
would be a case of easy in, easy out. He was sure that such
assumptions had been made before, and the consequences had been
disastrous. <I>You
can do this, Elliott</I>, he told himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“All safety checks
completed and route confirmed clear, Captain,” his ensign said,
yanking him from his thoughts and back to the bridge of the carrier.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Thank you,” Parks
said, and watched as the final few preparation craft cleared the way,
leaving the Confederation's
three most well-known carriers alone. “Open communications with
<I>Ifrit</I>
and <I>Leviathan</I>.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Above him two
two-dimensional holographic images sprang into existence, each
bearing the simple combination of black and white shapes that were
the CSN's insignia, against
a smooth black and white gradient background. The symbols were soon
replaced with images projected from their respective sources: one
displaying an image of Hawke, standing on the bridge of <I>Ifrit</I>;
the other, with Meyers and <I>Leviathan</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hello, gentlemen,”
Parks said. “Preparations aboard <I>Griffin</I>
are complete.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>Ifrit</I>
has also completed preparations,” Hawke confirmed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“As has <I>Leviathan</I>,
Commodore,” Meyers said. “Ready to jump on your order.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Very well,” Parks
nodded and looked to the ship's helmsman and navigator. “Mr Liu,
open a jump point to Aster.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir,” the man
tapped away at the multicoloured display of the console he sat at.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks watched the space
in front of the trio of huge carriers, as it began to twist and
distort. The distortions subsided quickly, leaving behind a
blue-tinged swirling mass, that turned like a lazy whirlpool.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Jump point opened,
sir,” Liu confirmed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Ready, gentlemen?”
Parks asked one last time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“With your lead,
Commodore,” Meyers confirmed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Ready,” Hawke
nodded his agreement.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>Are</I>
you <I>ready, Commodore?</I>
a voice within Parks asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>Yes</I>,
he said.</P>

Those observing from

and <I>Leviathan</I>'s
engines engaging and propelling them just behind <I>Griffin</I>.
The three ships slipped gracefully into the vicinity of the jump
point and then, one after the other, appeared to accelerate at
terrific speed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
A few seconds later,
the point closed behind them... and they were gone.</P>

hours passed as the three Confederation carriers made the journey
from Spirit to Aster, to meet with their appointment. During that
time, preparations were made for their arrival and the start of the
operation – Boarding parties suited up, checked their equipment,
and were once again briefed as to how they were to invade <I>Dragon</I>
and what their objectives were once they were inside; teams across
flight decks loaded armaments onto fighters and bombers, and
performed a variety of safety checks to ensure the craft could be
deployed in a timely fashion; others tucked into a piping-hot cooked
breakfast, as well as a plentiful supply of caffeine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
After struggling to
swallow a few mouthfuls, Dodds pushed much of the rest around, his
stomach warning him that he might come to regret consuming any more
of the fried food. In the end, he scraped what remained onto the
plate of a man sat opposite him, who was more than grateful of the
second helping. Much of the conversation at the table was focused on
the upcoming operation, mixed in with varied opinions of the fate of
<I>Dragon</I> and the
political strife within the Empire.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
A mug of tea and a
visit to the ship's doctor was enough to see Dodds through the
lengthy mission profile that proceeded breakfast. A round of
questions concluded the brief, and then it was back to the quarters
again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
A short while later,
the call came in – they were approaching Aster; all participants of
the Initial Run were to prep for deployment. The flyers jumped up
from seats and off bunks, filling corridors and lifts as they made
towards the flight decks, to answer the request.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds watched them go,
feeling Estelle's anguish at having to stay put until they were
required; if at all. Though he regretted the previous night's
activities, he hoped that his services would not be called upon. In
his groggy state, he was certain that to do so would only invite yet
more disaster, and he'd had enough of that for one lifetime. He was
determined to see the morning's wakeup call as the last he needed.</P>

Parks watched from the
bridge as the blue haze of jump space peeled away and the nearby
stars came rushing forward. The Aster system lay in close proximity
to a number of nebula: red, blue and green hues hanging like fine
silk curtains amongst the distant stars. There were few who failed to
be impressed by such a sight, many of the inhabited star systems
throughout the known galaxy lacking any such splendour. The
magnificence of the scene was not wasted on Parks either, despite the
reasons for their being in the system. He remained motionless for a
moment, to gaze upon it and felt some of his stress slip away.
<I>Griffin</I>
decelerated quickly, the stars around the carrier slowing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Jump completed,
sir,” he heard Liu say, as <I>Ifrit</I>
and <I>Leviathan</I>
came alongside. Though it was rare for accidents to occur during
jumps, it was good to see the other carriers were still with them. So
far, so good.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Excellent. Open
communications,” Parks said. The holographic screens sprang up once
again, and Hawke and Meyers appeared. “Commodore, Captain. Any
issues to report?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“None here,” said
Meyers. “Fighters and transports are prepped and ready to be
deployed on your command.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No reported issues,”
Hawke added. “Also ready for deployment.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
There was a flash by
<I>Griffin</I>'s
starboard side. A jump point was forming. From it emerged two
carriers of similar design to that of <I>Griffin</I>
and her two companions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sir, <I>Grendel</I>
and <I>Grendel</I><I>'</I><I>s
Mother</I> have just arrived in the system,” a man by
the name of O'Donnell,
<I>Griffin</I>'s
head of communications, said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Perfect timing,”
Parks said. He turned back to Meyers and Hawke. “Commodore,
Captain, deploy your teams. I want to ensure that we are able to
execute our strike not only the very second enemy forces appear, but
also if <I>Dragon</I>
arrives earlier than was originally anticipated. The element of
surprise should give them little chance to plot an escape and could
well be key to our success here today.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir. I will
begin fighter defence deployment immediately,” Meyers said, before
closing the communication link.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“And I will begin
preparation for rearguard, Commodore,” Hawke said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks opened his mouth
to speak, then hesitated. Hawke had volunteered to operate <I>Ifrit</I>
and its full complement alone as rearguard to the mission, defending
<I>Griffin</I>,
<I>Leviathan</I>,
<I>Grendel</I>,
and <I>Grendel</I><I>'</I><I>s
Mother</I>. Should enemy forces manage to attack the
main strike force from behind, Hawke would move <I>Ifrit</I>
in to offer support. Parks had raised doubts about the validity about
such a tactic, suggesting it would be better for Hawke to concentrate
<I>Ifrit</I>'s
strength up front, rather than reduce their offensive power. Even so,
Hawke had argued that whilst this would indeed allow them to take
down the enemy faster, they should not assume that enemy support
would not be forthcoming. To do so could risk the allied forces being
flanked or otherwise surrounded by hostile forces, meaning that
retreating from the system could prove difficult.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
After much deliberation
Parks had begrudgingly agreed to Hawke's
tactical proposals. But having now arrived at Aster, he was once
again considering ordering Hawke to remain up front. He pushed aside
the urge to enter into another debate with the man, not wanting to
stall the operation for even a second.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Very well,” Parks
said to Hawke. “I will be in contact as soon as we are ready to
begin manoeuvres.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He ended the
communication as another request came in. He acknowledged that it
should be received, and was greeted by the holographic projection of
a deceptively young-looking woman. She was graced with near flawless
olive skin, bright hazel eyes, and black hair, tied into a neat bob
on the top of her head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks had met Commodore
Sima Mandeep on a number of occasions before and each time had
forgotten just how beautiful he found her. He had always been
disappointed that he had never found the time to get to know her
better. Today was very unlikely to offer any such opportunity,
either.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Mandeep presented a
warm smile. “Hello, Elliott. Good to see you again. I hope we
didn't keep you waiting long.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Your timing was
perfect, Sima. We just arrived ourselves,” Parks said, finding it
difficult not to return the woman's smile, something about it feeling
a whole lot more personal than professional. Even her teeth looked
perfect.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Nice setting for
it,” she said, her eyes shifting to gaze upon the generous backdrop
they had been granted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I will be sure to
send you a copy of our footage, after everything is wrapped up.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Much appreciated,
Commodore,” she smiled again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks shifted the
conversation back to the operation. Now was not the time to be drawn
in. “We are beginning fighter defence preparations and will shortly
be executing tactical formation manoeuvres. As agreed, <I>Grendel</I>
and <I>Leviathan</I>
will lead the assault run. If you could have Captain Silverthorne
liaise with Captain Meyers to ensure that everything is in place,
then I will give the go-ahead for us to begin. <I>Griffin</I>
and <I>Grendel</I><I>'</I><I>s
Mother</I> will cover the midfield, with <I>Ifrit</I>
acting as rearguard.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He knew that Mandeep
had already been fully briefed on every aspect of the operation, but
reiterated it once more to ensure that all bases had been covered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Understood. I will
be in touch. <I>Grendel</I><I>'</I><I>s
Mother</I> out,” Mandeep said, before her face
disappeared from the holographic screen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks watched from the
bridge as a variety of craft streamed from each of the assembled
carriers and took up positions ahead of the group. A number of
fighters turned about and came to rest next to the capital ships.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“All of <I>Griffin</I>'s
Initial Run fighters and transports deployed and ready, sir,” Parks
was told.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Excellent, send word
that we are ready to move into position,” Parks ordered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The word was sent and
<I>Leviathan</I>
and <I>Grendel</I>
started forward, their starfighters following them like obedient
puppies. <I>Griffin</I>
and <I>Grendel</I><I>'</I><I>s
</I><I>Mother</I>
in turn followed at a distance, the four carriers all moving closer
to the expected arrival point of <I>Dragon</I>
and her escorts. If they were too far from <I>Dragon</I>'s
arrival point, it would give the battleship ample time to escape the
ambush. They slowed as they approached their designated positions and
Parks addressed all four carriers for one last time, before they
adopted radio silence and awaited their quarry.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Manoeuvres complete,
Commodore. In position,” Meyers reported.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“As we are,”
Silverthorne added. “We have boarding parties on standby.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“In position,”
Mandeep said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Rearguard ready,”
Hawke said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks noted that <I>Ifrit</I>
had barely moved since arriving at their destination. Though it
irritated him, he chose to ignore it. Hawke did have a somewhat
persuasive argument, but Parks still felt that his command and
firepower would be more appreciated up front. He once again buried
his feelings.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Good,” he said.
“You should each be aware of your role in this operation, which we
will begin the moment <I>Dragon</I>
is sighted. Should anything unexpected occur, that we cannot quickly
and effectively handle, then we will form a tactical retreat.
Commodore Hawke, I expect, will cover us in such an event.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You will have my
full support if such an event does arise,” Hawke replied.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Excellent,” Parks
said. “Excellent. Now we wait.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Although, from the way
his hands had started to perspire, he got the feeling that they
wouldn't be waiting for very long.</P>

Dodds sat up as the red
alert rang throughout the carrier, various orders and requests
sounding from the PA system and echoing down the ship's
corridors. He felt a sudden overwhelming compulsion come over him,
and he sprang off the bed and made for the quarters'
exit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">

said to the others.</P>

not keen to do the same.</P>

Enrique said, as he clambered off his own bed. Kelly followed suit,
stretching as she did so. Chaz tailed the two out the door, heading
off down the corridor, silent as ever. Dodds lingered by the
quarters' doorway.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hey, Dodds, what's
the holdup?” Enrique called back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Just a second,” he
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Okay,” Enrique
nodded and continued walking with Kelly and Chaz.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds looked back to
Estelle who was still perched on the end of the bed he had once
occupied. “You not coming?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, I'll
wait here,” Estelle said, shaking her head. “If they need us,
they'll look for us here,
first.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sure?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Positive.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds studied her. She
looked pensive. He made to head off, then hesitated and came back to
the doorway. “Are you okay?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah. Like I said, I
just want to make sure we can be contacted.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hmmmm, okay.”
Dodds was certain that Estelle, as he, knew that it was a not a
well-tailored excuse. The ship's
PA system could be used to contact anyone aboard the ship, no matter
where they were.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As he jogged down the
corridors to catch up with the others, he wondered if there was
something else playing on Estelle's
mind. Had she suffered a sudden attack of nerves the moment that the
alarm had started, the reality of the situation having only now sunk
in? Perhaps Estelle was now feeling some of the concern that had
gripped Kelly back on Spirit: realising that they wouldn't be
fighting against a bunch of pirates or supporting an assault on a
small, little-defended insurgent installation, but instead be facing
up against seasoned starfighter pilots and battleships.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>No</I>,
he thought to himself, catching up with the others who were holding
the door to the deck lift. <I>Estelle
just needs time to prepare.</I></P>

With the quarters
empty, Estelle lay back on the bed that Dodds had vacated and began
taking slow, measured breaths, her heart threatening to burst out of
her ribcage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Please stop
ringing,” she whispered to the alarm. “Just stop.”</P>

Emerging from the deck
lift, Dodds found himself in the one part of the ship that he would
have preferred to avoid, his arrival here a result of following
others, who also wished to observe the operation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>Griffin</I>'s
bar, located on the port side of the main elevated portion of the
carrier, offered a panoramic view of the surrounding space. The
intention was to provide a pleasant backdrop for those relaxing and
enjoying a drink. Due to its position, the bar was - aside from the
bridge - the best place on the carrier to get a feel for what was
happening outside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Many other crew members
were already clustered by the windows towards the bow and the four
<I>Knights</I>
hurried over to see what was happening, Dodds thankful that he was
spared the sight of any alcohol with the way that he was feeling.
Even before he had made it to the windows, Dodds could hear people
cursing under their breath.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>That</I>
is a big ship,” Chaz said. Taller than his companions, he did not
have to try and see between people's
heads, being able to look over them, instead.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds managed to find
himself a spot and felt an equal sense of pure ambivalence.
Unmissable, even at its distance ahead of <I>Griffin</I>,
was <I>Dragon;</I>
the massive battleship lying side on to their carrier, looking
graceful, yet menacing in every aspect. Ahead of them, <I>Grendel</I>
and <I>Leviathan</I>
could be seen approaching, the tiny blue specks of starfighter
engines leading the way.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Where are the
frigates?” Kelly asked, searching in all directions. She was
standing on a chair.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Don't
know. Can't see any,”
Dodds said, though he took little time to look. He found he was
unable to tear his eyes away from the battleship that was their
target.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Intelligence may
have got it wrong,” Enrique said. “Wouldn't
be the first time.”</P>

Parks had been bemused
by the appearance of the stolen Confederation battleship without its
escorts. Not that it needed any.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>Dragon</I>
had arrived in the system not long after the allied forces had
completed their tactical manoeuvres. A jump point had formed within
their vicinity and Parks had ordered the immediate commencement of
the operation. Bombers, alongside their support fighters, had surged
forward to greet the newest arrival to the Aster system. Troop
transports had joined just behind them, ready to attach themselves to
<I>Dragon</I>'s
hull and deploy their deadly cargo of toxic gases and boarding
parties, the moment the battleship was disabled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Prepare to transmit
the override, Mr O'Donnell,”
Parks said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Ready on your order,
sir,” O'Donnell said,
after verification at his console.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With the glow of
starfighter engines growing ever smaller, Parks turned to the four
holographic camera feeds he had earlier requested to monitor the
operation. Each was sourced from a different target: one traced the
starfighter and troop transports; another focused in on <I>Dragon,</I>
herself. Yet another followed <I>Leviathan</I>
and <I>Grendel</I>, and
the last, the cockpit view of the leader of the Initial Run flight
group.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Even from where he
stood, watching the holographic relays, Parks found the sight of the
massive Confederation battleship staggering. The fact that it was
also in the hands of the Enemy was causing him considerable
apprehension. He could not begin to imagine what the pilots seated
within the front-line might be feeling at this time; though with the
battleship having begun to turn to face its attackers, it could well
be a sense of utter foreboding.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Approaching <I>Dragon</I>,”
the flight group leader communicated to <I>Griffin</I>.
“Will be within weapons range in sixty seconds.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks noted that some
of the fighters were lowering their speed, so as not to expose
themselves to the battleship's
weapons systems too soon, their wingmates passing them by. Although
both <I>Dragon</I>
and the carriers that had come to meet it had been outfitted with
similar weaponry, the turrets of <I>Dragon</I>
had been upgraded to compliment the ship, granting them an increased
range and thereby allowing them to be fired from a greater distance.
That distance would soon be met by the flight group.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The closer the flight
group drew towards it, the sharper their target's details came into
relief. A graphic of a magnificent, blue-scaled Chinese dragon clung
to the battleship's hull,
its claws appearing to be latched deep into the metal. Dozens of tall
yellow and red ridges covered the creature's
back, whilst a pair of long, curved, white horns rose from the top of
its head. Its mouth was open, drawn back into a ferocious snarl,
displaying row upon row of sharp, pointed teeth. Two red eyes seemed
to project a furious warning, warding off would-be attackers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
But now, Parks was
satisfied that the flight group were as close as they needed to be.
He turned to his
chief communications officer. “Mr O'Donnell,
send the code.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sending code,”
O'Donnell acknowledged both
the commodore and the flight group. He made two brief strokes at his
console. “Code sent.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks further relayed
the update to all on the battlefield. The confirmations came back. He
then looked back to the holographic screens and waited. But after
only a few seconds, great trepidations overcame him and his eyes
flickered from one display to the next, seeing the same thing in
each: lights continued to illuminate the surface of <I>Dragon</I>;
windows, portholes, and exterior components, all visual indications
that the ship was still operational. He looked past the displays to
the scene beyond the carrier's frontal viewport, considering that the
feeds might not be running in real time, perhaps delayed by a few
seconds. <I>Dragon</I>
still glittered with light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Mr O'Donnell?
What's happening?” Parks said, not taking his eyes off the massive
battleship. <I>Have I just done
the unthinkable and underestimated the Enemy upon my very first
engagement?</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Code was transmitted
successfully, sir,” O'Donnell
replied, fingers darting across the console to confirm what he had
just done. “Do you want me to try again?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Will be within
weapons range in thirty seconds. Please advise,” came the voice of
the flight group leader, calm, but with a notable trace of urgency.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks' mind raced to
consider the possibilities and available options. There remained but
two: he could request that the code be sent again, or he could
immediately fall back to their other approach. If he requested the
code to be retried, it would mean that the fighters, bombers, and
landing parties would be vulnerable to <I>Dragon</I>'s
attack upon subsequent failure. On the other hand, the lack of
frigates in the system could mean it would be easier to secure a
forceful victory...</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Target disabled,
sir,” O'Donnell
interrupted his thoughts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks looked up from
his musings and saw that <I>Dragon</I>
had ceased turning and now lay in darkness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“All systems
terminated. Shielding, weapon systems and mechanics have been shut
down,” O'Donnell continued. “Life support is the only detectable
working component. There must have been a delay in the transmission
or reception of the code.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Gravitation
systems?” Parks asked, looking to the various feeds to gain a
better indication of <I>Dragon</I>'s
impairment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Down, sir,”
O'Donnell said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Good. Relay that
information to the boarding teams.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>So
far, so good</I>, Parks thought. Aside from the minor
delay, it looked as though everything was going according to plan.
There now only remained the matter of flooding the interior of <I>Dragon</I>
with toxins as arranged, picking off any adversaries that may have
managed to survive, and apprehending Admiral Zackaria, before rushing
medical assistance to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>A
pity we could not have shut down life support, too</I>,
Parks mused. <I>There
would be no need to board the ship. We could have simply towed it
back to Spirit and pulled the bodies out at the other end.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Phase one of the
operation is complete,” Parks said to the holographic images of his
fellow command. “<I>Grendel</I>
and <I>Leviathan</I>
will continue as planned. <I>Griffin</I>
and <I>Grendel</I><I>'</I><I>s
Mother</I> will stand their ground. Should <I>Dragon</I>'s
escorts arrive, then we will be in a better position to engage them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Agreed,” came the
resounding answer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Passing weapons
range,” the voice of the Initial Run's flight leader came again.
Parks looked back to the feed streaming from the Rook. Tension eased
away as it and the rest of the flight group passed the danger
threshold of <I>Dragon</I>'s
armaments, unchallenged.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The group were bearing
broadside to the battleship, the proximity now meaning that the
flight leader's cockpit view could no longer fully accommodate the
entire length of the colossal vessel. The words “C.S.N. Dragon”
inscribed in tall, bold red lettering were now so close that Parks
could start to make out where the paintwork was in need of touching
up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He beckoned to a member
of the bridge's security
team, who approached him. “Please locate Andrea Kennedy and the
other <I>Red
Devils</I>,
and ask them to join me on the bridge.” The man saluted and made
his way to the bridge's
lift, heading to the lower decks. Parks returned back to the mission
still in progress, preparing to co-ordinate and delegate duties
further when the time came.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Beginning final
approach,” the flight leader said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>Perhaps
I</I><I>'</I><I>ve</I>
overestimated <I>the
Enemy</I>, Parks thought, feeling his spirits lift.
<I>Maybe
I can do this, after all...</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Target is live!
Target is live!” the voice of the flight leader suddenly cried over
the bridge's comms system,
shattering Parks' illusions
and bringing him back down with a crash. The stunned man strode to
the very front of <I>Griffin</I>'s
bridge for a clearer view, feeling the need to look upon the
battleship with his own two eyes, rather than rely on the carrier's
cameras. The flight leader was not wrong. As lights on <I>Dragon</I>
sprang
back into existence, disbelief hit him full on.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What the hell just
happened?” Parks spun back around.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Power has just
returned to <I>Dragon</I>!
All systems are fully active!” O'Donnell
said, poring over his console's readouts. “Shields are returning...
Weapons and engine systems are powering up!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Resend the code!”
Parks said, fighting to keep the shock out of his voice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
O'Donnell's
fingers raced across the console. “<I>Dragon</I>
is rejecting it, sir!” he said after multiple attempts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks flew to the man's
side, leaning over the console display and seeing the multitude of
errors that were greeting O'Donnell
upon each unsuccessful attempt,</P>

“Abort! Abort!” the
cries of the flight leader came once more over the bridge's
comms system, accompanied by the noise of screaming computer systems,
warning him of multiple weapon locks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks watched as the
man pulled out of his approach to <I>Dragon</I>,
trying with all his might to shake off the battleship's
targeting systems. All around him, other craft could be seen
attempting the same. Parks caught sight of a massive turret swinging
around to face the flight leader. His eyes shifted to another of the
feeds, seeing, moments later, bright green bolts of plasma belch
forth, striking those behind him, scoring critical hits on some,
whilst obliterating others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The half-dozen bolts
become a veritable hail of fire, luminous bright green light flying
in every direction, lighting dozens of surfaces on both <I>Dragon</I>
herself and the allied forces.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Pulling ba-” the
flight leader began, before the audio became an ear splitting screech
of static. The video tore, froze, and then shut off altogether. In
another feed, Parks saw the damaged Rook wheel for a brief second
before it exploded, unable to evade <I>Dragon</I>'s
cannons any longer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The sound of loud
voices spilled from the holographic links of the three other frontal
carriers as they became a hive of noise, the captains barking new
orders to their teams, instructing them to fall back and move out of
weapons range. They, as he, all appeared stunned by the battleship's
miraculous recovery.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks swallowed. This
dragon had been watching them the whole time; it had just been
pretending to sleep. And unless he was able to
take back control of the operation that seemed to be falling apart in
front of him, there was little doubt that the Enemy would not
hesitate to turn the full power of the battleship against them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He fought to realign
himself and concentrate on falling back to attempting a forceful
victory. With the absence of the frigates, it might just be possible.
Just as he prepared to do so, his eyes were grabbed by one of the
remaining three feeds... and his blood froze.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With the allied fighter
squadron all but destroyed and its power restored, <I>Dragon</I>
continued
to turn, bringing its bow around to face <I>Grendel</I>,
the closest of the allied vessels to it. All along <I>Dragon</I>'s
bow, locks and components began to release, shifting and docking into
new positions. Gears engaged. A vertical seam appeared, running the
length of the bow. The seam split, both sides moving aside, as if a
great mouth were opening; the throat a cold, dark tunnel, leading to
oblivion. Parks felt his own throat close up, as the implications of
the move became all too clear: the Enemy were preparing to use the
battleship's main gun.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>Grendel</I>
had made little progress in its attempt to evade <I>Dragon</I>'s
attention, and as the enormous battleship brought itself around to
face, Parks wished for nothing more than to be able to leap through
the screen and pull them out of harm's way. But instead, he stood
rooted to the spot. There was nothing he could do. Silverthorne was
shouting orders, his image turned away in the projection. He then
looked back and Parks saw terror in his eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Had it not been for the
fact that the man had turned grey during his early twenties, Parks
may have thought that the predicament Silverthorne now faced was
wholly responsible for his appearance. Parks stared at him, as he
looked back in silence. The somewhat stone-faced man paled as he
lowered his eyes to looked out of <I>Grendel</I>'s
frontal viewport.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Edward...” Parks
started, before his own eyes fell to <I>Dragon</I>'s
holographic feed. For a few seconds, the battleship's
“throat” was lit by an intense violet hue. Then <I>Dragon</I>
fired.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
What looked like an
enormous bright white ball leapt from the front of the Confederation
battleship and hurtled towards <I>Grendel</I>
at a staggering velocity, taking mere seconds to traverse the
distance between the two vessels, where it struck it broadside on. A
tremendous explosion followed, for an instant appearing brighter than
the Sun and causing Parks to shield his eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Silverthorne's feed
died, the CSN insignia replacing it as it had done with the flight
leader's. Parks blinked, staring out the front of his ship to where
<I>Grendel</I> had once
stood. One moment it was there and the next... nothing. Not a single
piece of <I>Grendel</I>
remained. All that could be seen was a shower of particles, that
began to spread out and diminish, rippling as an invisible wave
expanded behind them. The sea of debris that often followed the
destruction of such a large vessel was nowhere to be seen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Oh dear God,” a
shocked voice came. Parks saw that Mandeep was covering her mouth,
her breathing coming short, her eyes wide with disbelief.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Commodore.” It was
Meyers. “We need to begin our counter-offensive as soon as
possible. If we do... could... t... Spirit.” The signal broke up
like a television signal in a thunderstorm. On one of the remaining
feeds, Parks saw <I>Leviathan</I>
buffeted by the expanding shock wave. “We cannot risk losing any
more vessels to that cannon,” Meyers concluded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Although Parks knew
that it would be quite sometime before <I>Dragon</I>
was able to muster the energy required to use such a weapon again,
whilst it remained, the cannon was a formidable threat. He found
himself in agreement with but one of Meyers' statements.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Abort the mission!”
he barked. “All ships, prepare to jump out of the system! Mr
Davies, order the launch of all available fighters, to cover our
retreat!” There was an unpleasant awareness that he was almost
certainly condemning those men and women to death. But at this very
moment, he had to follow protocol - and that meant that <I>Griffin</I>,
<I>Ifrit</I>,
and <I>Leviathan</I>
came first.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He heard a console
begin a frenzied jingle. “What's
that?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sir, jump point
forming!” the operator responded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks felt his stress
level spike. “Where?”</P>

Dodds halted in his
departure from the bar, running to meet the call for pilots, as a
brilliant flash lit the room, light reflecting off the windows and
wooden furnishings. Many of the other occupants had already left, but
he, as with his fellow <I>Knights</I>,
had found it hard to tear his eyes off the scene beyond.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
There had been applause
when <I>Dragon</I> had
been shut down, gasps upon its recovery, and then cries as it opened
fire. Dodds had looked on in horror as the hail of green bolts, clear
even from where <I>Griffin</I>
stood, flew around in every direction, striking targets and
triggering explosions as they fell. He saw then, as Chaz had said,
the fighter's attempts at returning fire was but a token gesture at
best, their weapons no match for the tough defences of the
Confederation flagship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What's that?”
Enrique stopped beside him, staring out the tall port side windows.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Jump point!” Chaz
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds swore as he saw
the bow of a large vessel come into view, accelerating out from the
point and coming to bear right alongside them. An arrangement of four
red triangles came into view; the insignia of the Imperial naval
forces.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It's one of the
frigates!” Chaz added.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Dear God, that
thing's close!” Dodds staggered back. He was able to read the
vessel's designation along the side, with no trouble whatsoever.
Never in his life had he seen a manoeuvre such as this. The frigate
was so close to them that it was - in astronavigational terms -
within spitting distance. It could not have been four hundred meters
from them, if that. One tiny error in its heading and the sides of
both ships would have been touching.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
But the frigate's
heading was precise and its course put it perfectly in line with
<I>Griffin</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, no, no, no!”
Dodds cried as the he saw cannons turn to face the carrier.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The words had not even
left his mouth when the frigate opened fire, engaging its entire
starboard battery at once and strafing the carrier's broadside. The
first volley of fire was quick to cut down <I>Griffin</I>'s
shielding, leaving the salvo that followed free to slam into the
unprotected hull of the ship and tear a gaping hole in the armour.
There were cries from the crew as fires and explosions engulfed them,
before several interconnecting corridors were then exposed to the
vacuum of space. Emergency systems sprung into action and sealed off
the affected areas, but not before several unfortunate personnel were
jettisoned through the gap.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>Griffin</I>
lurched violently and Dodds crashed to the floor, the air being
forced out of his lungs. Kelly and Enrique fell down beside him. Of
the few that remained in the bar, Chaz was the only one who managed
to steady himself against the jolt. Dodds rolled onto his side to
watch the frigate pass by. Its fat, cylindrical body reminded him of
an assault rifle, the long shaft of a cannon affixed to the underside
of the bow making suggestions of a bayonet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Seconds later, a slew
of starfighters joined it, streaking past the bar's
windows. Dodds could only assume that they had all entered into the
system together and hoped that there were not more jump points
surrounding the carrier. He had no time to find out - the view became
obscured by the closing blast screens, sealing off the vulnerable
glass windows, in case they should shatter and expose the ship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You all right?”
Enrique said, helping Kelly to her feet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah,” Kelly said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds got up, seeing
Chaz attending to another of the bar's occupants, who appeared to
have suffered a more serious fall.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Chaz,” he said,
making his way over towards the body that was sprawled out across the
floor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“He's okay,” the
big man looked around at him. “Just unconscious.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Simon - Estelle,”
Kelly said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah, we need to
find her,” Dodds said and started towards the deck lift. “She may
have been hurt.”</P>

From the bridge of

Admiral Zackaria watched the ensuing carnage with no emotion. He was
neither pleased nor displeased with what had occurred, only satisfied
that the enemy were being destroyed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
To his second in

All about <I>Dragon</I>'s

pilots dressed head to toe in black suits. Upon their heads they wore

they all acted without question, nor hesitation, as they prepared for
launch.</P>

Parks pulled himself to
his feet as others returned to their positions. He looked to the main
viewport at the front of the bridge, to reassess the standings
following the assault on his ship. He saw that the frigate was past
them now, accelerating away to come to rest in between the three
front-line carriers. The request for pilots was still ringing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Give me a damage
report,” Parks said, glancing from the frigate to <I>Dragon</I>.
Some information he did not need: he could see parts of his ship
drifting away, bodies floating in amongst the wreckage, already dead
and rigid in the cold. “Poor bastards.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Shields returning,
some structural damage to the midsection. Weapons and other major
systems have not been affected,” he was told.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>Grendel</I><I>'</I><I>s
Mother</I> and <I>Leviathan</I>
are deploying cover teams,” Liu said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“The fighters that
arrived with the frigate are looping back around on attack vectors,”
O'Donnell added.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
There was very little
for Parks to consider now. His number one priority was to ensure that
the allied forces could exit the combat zone and minimise losses.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Target those
incoming fighters and make ready to bring the jump engines on-line,”
Parks ordered. “Get every spare pilot we have out there to cover
our retreat. And get me Commodore Hawke!” He was determined to see
the man fulfil his role in this battle.</P>

Anthony Hawke continued
to observe the scene from the safety of <I>Ifrit</I>,
the carrier far detached from the battle that had erupted around the
allied forces. From where he stood, he could see <I>Griffin</I>'s
guns blazing, firing at attacking enemy targets. He felt no sense of
shame in watching.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Captain, fighter
support are asking whether or not they should engage the enemy
forces,” a young man seated close to where Hawke stood asked of
him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Tell them to hold
position,” Hawke said in a flat tone.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sir, begging your
pardon, but I think we should offer our assistance,” the man
protested. “<I>Griffin</I>
just suffered a major attack and I don't think we should be just
sitting here doing nothing.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We <I>wait</I>,
Lieutenant. Only one frigate has jumped into the system and we were
expecting two. If we move forward now, then we could be playing
straight into the enemy's
hands. We have already been tricked once by <I>Dragon</I>
and we don't want to walk
into another one of their traps.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“But, sir, if we
remain here and wait for a frigate that might not even show up, then
<I>Griffin</I> could be
destroyed. I really think we should assist.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Hawke looked at him
through cold eyes. “If you question my command one more time, Mr
Parsons, I will find you guilty of mutiny and have you locked in the
brig. Now follow my orders and tell those fighters to remain where
they are.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir,” Parsons
said, lowering his own eyes to his screen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sir, <I>Griffin</I>
is requesting communications,” Hawke heard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Put them on,”
Hawke said, folding his arms and carrying a look of impatience. A
holographic screen sprang up on front of him, Parks appearing on the
display.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We could use your
help up here, Anthony,” Parks said earnestly. “The additional
firepower will help us to withdraw all the sooner. We will need to
ensure that as many vessels as possible can be accounted for,
including <I>Grendel</I><I>'</I><I>s
Mother</I>.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I don't
think that's such a good idea,” Hawke said. “Moving all our
forces up front could leave us even more vulnerable. As already
agreed, <I>Ifrit</I>
will hold position here, to prevent enemy forces from being able to
surround us.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“But... Are you
serious?!” Parks spluttered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“My position is
clear,” Hawke said. Ahead of him, he could see small explosions
dotted around <I>Griffin</I>,
where starfighter fell and missiles connected.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks' face became
stern. “Commodore Hawke, your commitment to this operation has been
nothing short of disgraceful! You leave me with no choice but to
force the chain of command - and as the senior officer in charge of
this operation, I order you...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks stopped talking,
his holographic image turning away as someone interrupted him. The
communication came to an abrupt end.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“They seem to have
things under control,” Hawke said quietly, his face impassive.
“Hold position,” he called to the bridge, not taking his eyes off
the scene outside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
An explosion appeared
towards <I>Griffin</I>'s
bow and the carrier's once-stable course began to deteriorate, many
of the lights all about the ship flickering, before they extinguished
altogether.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Hawke's
nose was bleeding once again, but this time he did nothing about it,
letting the blood trickle from his nose and drip down onto the floor
of the bridge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hold position,” he
whispered.</P>

opened his eyes to find that the bridge lay in almost complete
darkness, and was filled with smoke. The events that had led him to
finding himself sprawled out on the floor escaped him, and he
realised that he must have blacked out for a few seconds. He noticed
a man on the floor next to him, with a glazed look in his eyes. A
trail of blood glistened as it trickled from his head. Parks became
aware that he was staring into the face of O'Donnell,
his CCMO. The man was dead. The commodore pulled himself to his feet
and looked to the frontal viewport, to the continuing scenes of
battle outside. He then remembered what had happened.</P>

As Parks had spoken to
Hawke, a member of the bridge crew had alerted him to a damaged
Imperial fighter streaking towards them. Even in its damaged state,
the pilot had been a master of his craft and had managed to guide it
straight towards <I>Griffin</I>'s
launch bay, whilst evading all the carrier's
attempts to bring it down. As it had disappeared from view, security
cameras all about the flight deck had relayed the short, but terrible
seconds that followed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Deckhands had watched
horrified as the last bursts of the fighter's
cannons had eliminated what remained of the bay quadrant's
already weak shielding and sped down the launch tunnel towards them.
There were cries of panic from the crew and awaiting pilots, before
people had fled in all directions, some attempting to take cover
behind cargo containers whose contents would offer nothing but a much
swifter death. A missile had detached from the bottom of the fighter,
slamming into the forcefield that lay ahead. With its last obstacle
overcome, and with nothing left to stop it, the Imperial fighter had
slammed straight in a row of waiting TAFs, all in the process of
being rearmed, where it had gone on to do the most damage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Its unspent payload of
missiles had exploded, along with its reactor. Unopposed, the blast
had ripped its way across the entire deck, which - as was its nature
- was stocked full of volatile equipment. The resulting chain
reaction had impacted almost every area of the ship, including the
bridge, the total damage being nothing short of astronomical.</P>

Parks felt a warm flow
on the side of his head. He placed his hand against his temple and,
even in the half-light of the bridge, could see the blood covering
his fingers. His left arm was also aching from where he had fallen on
it. From the bridge's
frontal viewport, he could see that the carrier was no longer aligned
with the on-going battle and that the blast must have thrown them off
course. The view was skewed, no longer aligned at an angle
appropriate to the task.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He turned back to the
bridge itself, trying to see down its length, but finding that the
smoke and haze was making it almost impossible to see what was
happening around him. There was a sudden loud clunking noise, the
sound of emergency systems engaging, and the bridge was filled with
dim lighting, allowing Parks to see the true extent of the damage:
consoles sparked and smoked; people lay slumped forward in their
chairs, burns all about their bodies, where equipment had exploded in
front of them. Parks hoped that for their sakes they were already
dead. Others were struggling to their feet, some trying to wake the
unconscious and checking them for injuries.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Talk to me, people!”
Parks called, his voice a distant sound even in his own head, as he
struggled to regain all his senses.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Here, Captain,” a
voice answered. It was Liu. Aside from the bruising on his face and
an injured left arm, he looked none the worse for wear, more shocked
than anything; though the inability to take his eyes off the dead,
still form of O'Donnell was
not helping.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Stay calm,
Lieutenant,” Parks urged the man, drawing his focus away from the
corpse. “Are you hurt?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, sir. Well, I am
a little, but nothing I can't
cope with, sir,” Liu managed, his eyes dropping once again to the
corpse splayed out on the floor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks reached out and
put a hand on the man's shoulder. “I need you to stay focused and
maintain order here, Ali. Can you do that?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Good, you have the
bridge,” Parks said. “I have to get to the flight deck and find
out what the hell's happened.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir,” Liu
said, managing to tear his eyes off O'Donnell.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Leaving Liu to focus on
getting the bridge back to order, Parks hurried to the stairwell,
limping as he went.</P>

Estelle stumbled down
the poorly-lit corridors of the carrier's
lower deck, trying desperately to locate the other <I>Knights</I>.
She had been making her way towards the flight deck when the Imperial
fighter had crashed onto it, plunging the entire ship into darkness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She had been lying on
the bed vacated by Dodds, when the call for pilots had come in. She
started towards the quarters' door, when a loud explosion and the
rocking of the carrier knocked her off her feet and sent her tumbling
backwards, causing her to strike her head against one of the metal
beds. The blow had not caused any serious damage, but had left her
with a headache. She was now experiencing a dull ache, that smarted
with each step she took.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She had to find Dodds,
Kelly, Enrique and Chaz. She had decided to head straight to the
flight deck, in anticipation of finding them there. Other crew
members were running and pushing past her, hurrying to deal with
their own problems. As she continued her journey, she discovered an
emergency door was cutting off her most direct route. She doubled
back, attempting to find another way around.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Estelle!” a
desperate voice cried out to her. Along a smoky corridor, just off
from the one she walked down, a woman lay on her back, buried beneath
wreckage that had fallen from the ceiling. From where Estelle stood,
the wreckage appeared to have trapped the woman's
legs and one of her arms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle started forward
to try to help.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Be careful!” the
woman shouted to Estelle as she approached.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Andrea?!” Estelle
asked, startled as she saw who it was trapped beneath the collapsed
steel. She gingerly walked forward, wary of any loose sections of the
roof that may not yet have fallen, as well as dangling electricals.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Estelle, help me...
No-one will stop to help me... Please,” Andrea pleaded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle looked around
herself for a way to help her remove the wreckage, but could see
nothing that could be of any assistance. “What happened?” she
asked, kneeling down next to Andrea.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We were heading for
the bridge, the others were... walking just in front of me... The
wall ahead of us exploded. I managed to grab on to something, but the
others...” she started to weep.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What happened?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“They were spaced! I
couldn't save them, Estelle!
Their faces... I watched them die,” she said through the sobs. “I
tried to find another way to the bridge... and then the ceiling came
down on top of me... Estelle, I can't
move my legs... It hurts so much...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
It had become apparent
to Estelle that Andrea's
legs had been crushed by the collapsed roof, and that the same fate
had befallen the woman's
trapped arm. She grabbed at some of the steel, trying to find a way
to pry it loose. When it became clear that it was not going to budge,
she moved around to try another section. She only managed to move a
handful of light parts, before the heavier portions of the wreckage
defeated her. Andrea watched her the whole time, coughing and
sobbing. Estelle ducked down next to the woman, trying to see if
there was a way to pull her out from under the mess. There was none.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm
going to find help,” Estelle said, standing up. “I won't
be long, I promise.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Okay,” Andrea
managed, gravely.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle hurried away,
darting down the corridors, looking for someone to assist her. Few
paid her any attention, Estelle unable to get the words out before
the person she tried to stop pushed past her, and those that did
listen already had higher priorities. She wished that the others were
here now. The five of them would have little trouble freeing the
trapped woman. Even Enrique and Chaz would have had enough strength
between them. Eventually, a man and woman followed her back to the
scene.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Andrea,” she
called, returning to the trapped woman's
side. “I've got help.
Don't worry, we'll
have you free...” She stopped talking and knelt by the curly-haired
blonde, seeing her eyes open, staring straight upward, a trickle of
blood running from her mouth. “Andrea?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The woman who had
followed Estelle knelt by her side and felt Andrea's neck. She then
shook her head. “She's
dead.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Help me!” a
hysterical cry came from behind. Estelle saw the woman next to her
turn around, and then spring up to assist the owner of the voice. She
heard those that had accompanied her to where Andrea lay, urging
someone to keep calm, before all three hurried from the scene, their
voices fading away down the corridor as they went.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle saw none of it,
her eyes focused on Andrea's
face, racked with the guilt of the jealousy she had felt only hours
earlier. She reached down and closed the dead woman's
eyes, no longer wishing she could be in her place.</P>

An out of breath Parks
arrived at one of the flight deck's
observation galleries; or at least, what remained of it. All access
to the deck had been sealed off, blast doors preventing anyone from
getting any closer to the source of the devastation that had crippled
the carrier. Even the gallery refused to permit its occupants any
idea of the destruction that lay beyond: thick blast screens covered
the windows, allowing them to see no further than the inside of the
room.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The smouldering remains
of terminals and computer screens, as well as shattered glass
covering the ground, was all that remained to suggest what the
gallery's purpose may have
been. Everything around Parks was charred black, the damage spreading
down the approaching corridor. The doors, which usually slid open
automatically as they were approached, had to be pushed apart by
hand. As on the bridge, people were attending to the wounded and
trying to revive others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Kneeling down on the
floor, just inside the doorway, was a woman attending to the injuries
of a man, propped up against a wall. His face was quite bloody, the
result of a wound somewhere on the top of his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Captain,” he said
upon seeing Parks enter. He pushed aside the woman's
hand and attempted to get to his feet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“As you were,”
Parks said, waving him back down. Though they were injured, Parks had
found that some of the carrier's
crew still attempted to adhere to a certain standard of correctness.
Right now, he did not want either of these two to stand and salute.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What's
the status of the flight deck?” he asked, though by the state of
the observation deck he believed he already knew the answer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Badly damaged,”
answered the man on the floor, wincing as the woman tended to his
wounded head. She was now making a clumsy effort to wrap a bandage
around the affected area. “There is no hope of launching fighters
until it receives some extensive repairs, and that won't
be before we re-establish the forcefields. The whole deck has been
exposed to space. If we open it up, then we risk depressurising the
entire ship.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Survivors? Anyone
still alive down there?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Not a chance. If
they weren't killed when that damn fighter hit, then they would have
been spaced straight after. We'll have lost everyone: pilots,
attendants, the OOD and the junior, technicians and munitions
handlers...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Stay calm, man!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Captain!” another
voice came.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks looked around as
a man came bounding up the stairs to the remains of the observation
room; it was the security officer who he had sent to fetch Andrea.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“The <I>Red
Devils</I> are dead, sir. They were spaced during the
frigate's initial attack.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Though he knew the
shock on his face was clear for all to see, Parks made no attempt to
conceal it. This was news that he had not been prepared for. As it
stood, the entire plan to attack and retake <I>Dragon</I>
had been nothing short of a total disaster. Even retreating would not
be possible until the engines were brought back on-line, and
abandoning the ship was not an option. The evacuees would be sitting
ducks in their escape pods. Prisoners would not be taken, lives would
not be spared. Even without full shielding or weapon systems, they
stood a much better chance of survival by remaining on the carrier
and attempting to restore power, than floating around in escape pods
in the middle of the battlefield.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
And minutes from
destruction or not, Parks would <I>never</I>
abandon <I>Griffin</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Regaining some of his
composure, the commodore felt his shock turn to anger at his own
stupidity. He turned to the man and woman on the floor next to him.
“You two, once you are able, start organising an assessment of
repairs needed to the flight deck. We must find a way to launch
fighters. If we cannot get weapons systems or shielding back on-line
then we will be totally defenceless.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“At once, sir,” the
man said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Come with me,”
Parks said, looking at the bridge security officer. They started back
to the stairways interconnecting the carrier's decks. “I want you
to get as many crew members as possible to help with repairs, skilled
in that field or not. The restoration of power to the engines,
shields and weapon systems should be our number one priority.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“In the meantime, we
must find a way to defend ourselves,” Parks continued. “<I>Leviathan</I>
and <I>Grendel</I><I>'</I><I>s
Mother</I> will only be able to provide cover for so
long against a dedicated attack on us. The ATAFs weren't
on the flight deck and can still be deployed, but with the <I>Red
Devils</I> dead, we have no-one to fly them...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We can fly them,
sir!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks spun around at
the sound of the familiar voice, to see Estelle, Dodds, Enrique,
Kelly, and Chaz all standing behind him; the five <I>White
Knights</I> shining like a beacon before his eyes,
against the dark of the corridor. He looked to the security guard and
gave his next order without even one second's
hesitation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Get them to the rear
cargo hold.”</P>

he stood in <I>Griffin</I>'s
rear cargo hold, Dodds was at a loss for words. The footage that he
had viewed of the ATAF back on Xalan had failed to fully convey the
magnificence that he now felt radiating from the craft. Even in the
dim ambience of the emergency lighting, the sleek black armour of the
fighters seemed to gleam with elegance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He found himself drawn
towards it, and approached to run his hand over the smooth curvature
of the nose, his eyes wandering across every surface, absorbing every
detail. He found it beautiful, but knew that that beauty concealed
the fighter's nature. As he
continued to gaze upon the craft, he began to understand how Estelle
sometimes felt, striving always for moments like this. He caught the
dim reflection of Enrique in the fighter's armour. The man was
standing beside him, his face frozen with an equal look of reverence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The spacious cargo hold
had been quite empty when the five starfighter pilots had entered it,
containing only the ATAFs and equipment necessary to handle them. It
was now beginning to fill with other personnel, who had come
streaming in to aid with the launch of the fighters. They buzzed
around, for a time ignoring the <I>White
Knights</I>
and concentrating
on what had to be done.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds took little
notice of them, hearing only their dim voices in the background. One
was speaking to Estelle.</P>

“Yep! Fully prepped
and ready to go, Lieutenant.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Right, right...
Dodds, Enrique, get over here,” she called to the men who were
still lost in their admiration of the craft before them. There was
the sound of running feet, and she looked around to see an out of
breath, red-faced man come sprinting into the cargo bay, almost
knocking down several others in his haste.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Commodore Parks
wants you to get these guys out there, ASAP!” he gasped to the
conning officer. “<I>Dragon</I>
just deployed fighters and unless we get these guys out there now...
What the hell are those?” He was staring at the ATAFs lining the
walls.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
There was a loud
clunking sound and the occupants of the cargo hold found themselves
squinting against the glow of the carrier's
restored lighting. Silence gave way to the sound of various pieces of
machinery and computer system starting back up. <I>Griffin</I>
had come alive once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Okay, here's
the plan,” Estelle said as her wingmates drew around her. “I will
takeoff first, to get an overview of the standings and liaise with
Commodore Parks. Dodds, I want you out next, followed by Kelly,
Enrique, and then Chaz. Once we are out there, I will issue you all
with objectives.” She looked to the ATAFs. “Just... just remember
– it's like flying a TAF.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She could hear her
voice quivering ever so slightly; the anticipation of what was to
come was causing her to draw breath much faster than usual. She
turned to the conning officer. “Ready?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Ready,” she
replied, signalling to others in the bay, who wheeled over a ladder
so that Estelle could enter the cockpit. “Those special
considerations I mentioned: we're
not able to set up any sort of launch catapult down here, so you're
going to have to maintain a hover whilst we rotate the inner and
outer forcefields. You okay with that?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No problem,” said
Estelle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The conning officer
looked to the other four, who nodded their understanding. Then, to
Estelle, she said, “Don't
boost until you're fully
clear, otherwise you could cause major damage to the hold. Clear?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Understood,”
Estelle said. She leapt up the ladder, scooped up the helmet that was
nestled into the seat and slipped it over her head. Despite the ATAF
evaluation program being concluded several weeks ago, the cockpit
layout was still fresh in her mind. Her fingers pressed buttons and
flipped switches as they had done many times before, the
starfighter's systems coming
on-line just as she expected. As the last notification appeared,
Estelle informed the flight crew that she was ready to go. She then
took up the position the conning officer had requested.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She could feel her
heart beating hard, threatening once more to burst out of her chest;
though now out of sheer exhilaration, rather than fear and
uncertainty.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>This
is it, girl. This is what it has all been about</I>,
she thought to herself. <I>Do
yourself proud. Do us all proud.</I> Looking to her side, she
gave a thumbs-up to her wingmates and then faced forward as the cargo
bay doors slid apart. Moments later, the forcefield rotated, the
all-clear was given, and she accelerated out.</P>

Beyond <I>Griffin</I>,
the battle raged on. Though <I>Grendel</I><I>'</I><I>s
Mother</I> and <I>Leviathan</I>
were struggling against the increased enemy presence, they had still
managed to earn <I>Griffin</I>
a reprieve. After seeing the damage their allied carrier had
sustained, and the loss of stability, Meyers and Mandeep had ordered
all their crew and starfighters to divide themselves between
protecting all three carriers. Against the odds, their efforts were
admirable, but cracks were beginning to show in their defence, the
increasing swarm of enemy fighters on the verge of overcoming the
allied forces. <I>Grendel</I><I>'</I><I>s
Mother</I> had held her position next to <I>Griffin</I>,
Meyers taking <I>Leviathan</I>
to stand some way in front of them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You're
going to have to work harder to keep those fighters off us,” Meyers
told the allied squadrons. “If they put either <I>Leviathan</I>
or <I>Grendel</I><I>'</I><I>s
Mother</I> out of commission, then it's
all over.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Doing our best,
captain,” one of the pilots responded. “But these guys are
proving tougher than expected. I've
never seen Imperial pilots fly like this before!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That's because
Imperial pilots <I>don't</I>
fly like that!” another pilot broadcast his feelings to the entire
field, the anxiety unmistakable in his voice. “I've
flown against them before, and these guys... these guys are something
else! Those are <I>not</I>
Imperial pilots in those fighters!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
They were the same
concerns that Meyers had heard levied by many others about the field.
The skills possessed by those commanding the Imperial starfighters
was truly something to behold: it was as though they were more than
capable of exploiting every weakness of their opponents, whilst at
the same time able to anticipate and compensate for every return
attack. Their reactions were unparalleled, as if they had minutes to
deal with situations that others were required to handle in seconds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Captain, power has
been restored to <I>Griffin</I>,”
came a voice from the bridge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Meyers turned from
where he had been watching a pair of TAFs' luckless attempts at
taking down an Imperial fighter, to see that <I>Griffin</I>
was once again back on-line. He was relieved to
see that the enemy fighter that had crashed into its flight deck had
not left the carrier permanently dead in the water.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Thank God for that.”
He turned to his communications officer. “Have you managed to
establish contact with
Commodore Parks yet?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Negative, sir,”
the woman answered. “There is too much signal corruption to
maintain a stable connection. The link keeps dropping out every few
seconds. Their comms system must still be down.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Keep trying,”
Meyers said, staring at the swarm of Imperial starfighters that had
just issued from <I>Dragon</I>.
Against such odds, they would need some sort of miracle to see them
through to the end of the day.</P>

The <I>Knights</I>
were clear of <I>Griffin</I>,
and the ATAFs looped around the rear of the carrier, to face the
incoming threat. Dodds realised that the situation they now faced
mirrored one from the many hours they had all put into the
simulators. It reminded him of the team's
very first failure and of how the training manager had assured them
it had been designed to be unfair, unrealistic, and not ever likely
to occur in real life. With all that in mind, he approached the
battle with added caution.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle's orders -
derived from what she had managed to understand from Parks, between
the static and regular loss of signal – further compounded it. They
were to lend support to the three carriers that were attempting to
escape the system, providing extra support to <I>Griffin</I>
in its crippled state. Parks had also requested that they attempt to
take down the frigate at the earliest opportunity.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“... though it looks
like we're going to have to
fight our way through this lot, first,” Estelle concluded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds noted that whilst
some of the fighters that had departed <I>Dragon</I>
had peeled off from the main group and were headed in the direction
of <I>Leviathan</I>,
the majority were headed straight towards
<I>Griffin</I>
and <I>Grendel</I><I>'</I><I>s
Mother</I>;
and with them, the <I>Knights</I>.
Dodds swallowed and then braced himself. Along with his wingmates, he
put himself on an intercept course with the approaching squadron and
sped towards them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As they drew within
range of one another, both sides spread out to gain more fighting
room, three of the Imperial fighters aligning themselves with Dodds.
He eyed his opponents. Though he had never seen them outside of a
simulated environment, there was no mistaking the form of an Imperial
Mantis: a Y-shaped frame and egg-like body, where the cockpit and
single large engine resided. Three struts jutted out of the body, a
single cannon affixed to the tips of the frame's
top two; the lower, central one, home to a number of missiles, set
into a rack. Though not visible from the distance, Dodds recalled
that the fighter's designers had also seen fit to squeeze on another
pair of guns, just beneath the main body. The appendages appeared
almost as if they were claws and mandibles, poised to rip their
opponent apart; the maroon hues of the Imperial colour schemes that
decorated the armour looking like the blood of its previous victims.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The three fighters
continued to close in on him and Dodds held his course unwavering,
making no indication that he intended to deviate from his present
course. He kept in mind his experiences of the ATAF back on Xalan,
confident that the fighter he occupied was in every way superior to
those he faced, no matter the odds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Weapons ranges were
met, and at once the three Mantises' guns opened up, a torrent of
green and purple bolts streaking towards him. At the sight, he felt
his heart leap into his throat, panic deriding the pride he had felt
only moments earlier. He banked hard to evade the shower, though not
as fast as he would have liked. Much of the enemy fire hit home, his
fighter's encasing shields bathing the entire cockpit in rippling
blue hues as they absorbed the hits.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As the Mantises
streaked past, Dodds' hand flew to the ejection handle, preparing to
blow the canopy and jettison himself out of the doomed craft, the
moment he heard the blare of the warning siren. It never came, and
all was silent, save for the jumble of noise from his comms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Relief washed over him
as he glanced to the instrument panel. The attack he had feared had
barely even registered. It was like the first day with the simulators
all over again, where he had found it difficult to get used to the
fact that the ATAF could handle itself far better in combat than
anything else he had ever flown.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He exhaled, though his
heart was still beating hard. He then wheeled the ATAF around and
gave chase to the three Imperial fighters that had just passed him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With the realisation
that their target had been spared destruction and was now tailing
them, the Mantis group dived. Dodds stayed behind them during the
manoeuvre and the ones that they followed up with, utilizing all the
skills he had been taught. He then shifted his heading over, so that
his crosshairs met with the HUD's predictive targeting receptacle,
before returning fire.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
It was far from the
first time he had seen it, but the resulting hail of fire from the
ATAF's cannons still floored him; even more so when his target
connected with the thick stream of plasma bolts. The Mantis exploded,
scattering metals, alloys, and sparking components in every
direction. Dodds was quick to react to its allies, who were pulling
away, repeating the same tried and tested technique against them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Thirty seconds later,
Dodds found himself victorious, staring at the tumbling remnants of
an enemy that had at first outnumbered and outgunned him. A small
chuckle of disbelief escaped him, and he turned about to face the
ongoing struggle he had lost sight of during his fight.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
His eyes swept across
the scene: cannon fire, lasers, missiles, and fighters of various
different configurations flew in every direction. <I>Leviathan</I>'s
and <I>Grendel's Mother</I>'s
cannons were hunting targets within the hordes of Imperial fighters
that were swarming all about them. At one time a sight such as this
might have terrified him; made him wish that he was some place else.
Not now.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He looked for the
W-shaped forms of the other four ATAFs in amongst the swashes of
other fighters, then gave up. He would find him them later. For now,
there were bigger issues to address. He could see more Imperial
fighters turning his way. He suspended his disbelief, buried his
sense of glory, and took a good grip on the stick.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Okay, let's see what
this thing can really do.” He raised his velocity to maximum and
dove headlong into the chaos.</P>

With power restored to
<I>Griffin</I>, Parks was
once again able to immerse himself back into the battle. For all the
damage the carrier had incurred, he was surprised – and grateful –
to discover that the on-board camera systems and audio transmissions
had been least affected. As the feeds tracked the ATAFs speeding
around the conflict zone, he caught snatches of reaction from other
allied fighters, whilst the bridge crew attempted to establish a more
stable comms system.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Who the hell are
<I>they</I>?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I don't
know, I've never seen them
before!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Are they on our
side?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I don't know -
there's no markings on
them!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Should we attack?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No! They're not
shooting at <I>us</I>;
they're shooting at <I>them</I>!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
From what Parks could
tell, the Enemy forces had ceased many of their attacks on the allies
present, concentrating all their efforts on attempting to bring down
the five unknown starfighters that were tearing their way through
their forces. Although, for all their might, they may as well have
been trying to hold back the tide.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Captain, we've
managed to establish a stable connection with <I>Leviathan</I>,”
Parks heard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Audio?” he asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Both audio and
visual, sir.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Finally,” he said
and turned away from where he had been watching one of the ATAF's
astral acrobatics. “Bring it up.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The holographic image
of <I>Leviathan</I>'s
captain was far from perfect. Even under normal operation the image
and audio could suffer from breakup and distortions, as the signal
failed in places. It was now a permanent mess of discolouration and
blocky pixels, the audio scratchy and accompanied by white noise. But
it represented the best efforts of the crew in the time given to
them, and, for now, fulfilled its purpose.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“How are you holding
up, Aiden?” Parks said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Better than you, by
the looks of things, Elliott.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks picked at some of
the blood caked to his face. Aside from a handful of painkillers, he
had refused any proper medical attention once he had learned he was
suffering from nothing more than a superficial head wound.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Meyer said, “I
requested that Commodore Hawke bring <I>Ifrit</I>
up front to lend their support for our withdrawal, but I'm sorry to
say that he point-blank refused. I did my best, sir.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks waved away the
man's apology. He had long since given up attempting to involve Hawke
in the battle, communication problems notwithstanding. Should they
both survive the day, he would be bringing his actions - or lack
therefore of - to the attention of Turner and Jenkins, as well as
other top brass. He could not believe that someone whom he had once
seen as a good friend and mentor would desert him in his hour of
need. But for the moment, there were more important things to deal
with.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Meyers'
attention turned for a moment and he looked back at Parks. “I see
you managed to deploy the ATAFs.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Eventually. And by
all accounts they are exceeding expectations.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“As are the <I>Red
Devils</I>.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks shook his head.
“The <I>Red
Devils</I> aren't
piloting the ATAFs, Captain, the <I>White
Knights</I> are. Unfortunately, the <I>Red
Devils</I> lost their lives when the frigate attacks
us.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hell, that's...
regrettable,” Meyers said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Although Parks felt the
same way, there was no time for anyone to grieve. “Captain, I want
<I>Leviathan</I>
to fall back to my position, so that we can complete our withdrawal.
I have ordered the <I>White
Knights</I> to engage the frigate and <I>Dragon</I>'s
fighter wing, to provide you with cover.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“The frigate <I>and</I>
the fighters?” Meyers said, looking stunned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks raised a hand.
“Don't worry, Captain, they can cope. This is an ideal opportunity
to collect combat data on the fighter. I shouldn't
worry too much about the threat of attacks from the Enemy for now -
they have enough to contend with as it is.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Very well,
Commodore,” Meyers said. “I will prep torpedoes in case things
turn ugly.”</P>

Hawke had watched the
battle from the bridge of <I>Ifrit</I>
without a flicker of emotion, despite the numerous calls from his
crew that they should move in to assist. They challenged him no
longer, the threat of a stay in the brig and a disciplinary hearing,
should they continue to question his command, being enough to silence
them. Even after the damage that <I>Griffin</I>
had sustained, he had refused to acknowledge the calls for assistance
by Meyers, who could do nothing but ask, unable to order the higher
ranking officer to take action.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
But now, Hawke was
almost ready to make his move. He turned to the carrier's
helmsman. “Prepare to take us forward on my command, Mr Cox.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">

Dodds continued to
strike down the Imperial starfighters that darted about him. His
adversaries, for all their impressive flying skills, were able to do
little to protect themselves from the advantages the ATAF granted
him. They could only weave and dive for so long to throw off the
targeting systems, before they succumbed to the hail of fire that
chased them, or were downed by another of the <I>White
Knights</I>.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He had long ago lost
count of the number he had taken down; though judging by the sheer
amount of debris that now floated around, littering the area between
the two sides, it must have been a lot. He was certain that at one
time the bulk of the wreckage had been made up of the remains of
allied Confederation and Independent craft. But in only a short space
of time, the <I>Knights</I>
had managed to drive the enemy away from the four carriers and were
now on the offensive, plunging deeper into the cluster of <I>Dragon</I>'s
support.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He had since caught up
with his fellow wingmates and asked each in turn if they were in need
of any assistance. None of them were, all confident that they stood a
good chance of handling the battle all by themselves. Dodds agreed.
The effect of the attacks brought against his fighter's defences were
so minimal that he had taken to more or less ignoring them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As he sought out his
next target within the scrum, a group of Imperial fighters ahead of
him slowed, flipped around and sped away. A wing further up field
followed suit. Glancing around his canopy, he saw others performing
similar manoeuvres, a blur of Mantises, Jackals, and Sphinxes racing
past him, their guns silent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Enemy fighters are
pulling back,” he heard Chaz's voice come over his comms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds held his own
fire, watching as his enemies fell back to more defensive positions,
drawing a line between the allied forces, <I>Dragon</I>,
and the frigate. A pair of ATAFs came up alongside him and brought
themselves to a halt.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
In the brief calm that
followed, he considered the scene before him: they were five lone
fighters, pitted against a frigate, dozens of Imperial starfighters,
and a monstrous forty-five-hundred-metre battleship. But they were
also five fighters that had caused their opponents considerable
upset. His hand tightened on the stick, readying himself for the
anticipated push.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle was quick to
issue new instructions to the team, aiming to capitalize on the break
in the enemy's attacks whilst they reorganised themselves, and
ordering Kelly, Enrique, and Chaz forward to take down the frigate
that was still exchanging long distance fire with <I>Leviathan</I>.
She then ordered Dodds to follow her lead, and the two swung about,
the pilot becoming aware of the reasons for splitting the team –
Emerging from a jump point, just behind where the three allied
carriers had gathered themselves, was the expected second and final
frigate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
An eager Estelle raced
ahead of him and he shot after her, surging through their own ranks
to tackle the approaching warship.</P>

As Estelle and Dodds
headed toward the second frigate, Kelly, Enrique, and Chaz made for
the first. Missiles, plasma bolts, and laser sprayed towards the
three as the frigate's cannons focused on them. They avoided much of
the barrage, the missiles that sought them falling to the
starfighter's countermeasures. What remained of the frigate's attack
was easily fended off by their shielding.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With Kelly's lead, the
three tackled their target in a similar manner to the way they had
done time and time again on Xalan: starting with their lasers, they
circled the vessel until the biting red beams had made significant
impacts on its defences. Next, they flew up and around, racing
lengthways across it, bombarding the topside with their own missiles.
Finally, they looped back around, skimming over the surfaces and
concentrating their cannons on the weakest structural points.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
All the while the
frigate returned fire, bolts, beams, and missiles chasing the three
starfighters, all failing to stave off the attack. It was not long
before the midsection began to come apart, explosions haemorrhaging
the hull and bulkheads, and began to tear the frigate apart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Soon after, the three
<I>Knights</I> pulled out
of their assault and re-focused on the Imperial fighters, who had
been able to do little else except standby helpless as the ATAFs
dispatched the ship they had escorted in.</P>

Dodds and Estelle
plunged into the second frigate's
fighter escort as they streaked past <I>Griffin</I>,
lending support to the carrier's defences that had been caught on the
back foot.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“The first frigate
has been taken down,” Estelle said, not a few minutes into their
engagement.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Already?” Dodds
said in disbelief. He could have put full trust in his radar, but
instead he wheeled around to witness the final moments of the
frigate, as it was torn asunder by the explosions that continued to
issue forth. He lingered for a while, aware of the fire striking him,
but paying it no more attention than he had before.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The questions returned:
just what <I>was</I> this thing that he sat in? Had the Confederation
really built this alone? And if they had, for what purpose? This was
not just the next step up, it was a leap; and giant one at that.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle's voice dragged
him back. “We need to hurry up, Dodds. These guys won't
be able to handle the fighters themselves and <I>Griffin</I>
is in trouble if that frigate gets any closer.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He adjusted his heading
to pass over <I>Griffin</I>
and onward to meet the approaching frigate. As he drew closer, he
concluded that the quickest solution to the problem of the frigate
was to employ the use of his fighter's plasma accelerator. Having
only used the weapon during the first few days of the ATAF's
simulated courses, a real world test was long overdue.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Traversing the craft's
system menus, he located the screen he needed to activate the weapon,
only to be confronted with an access denial. He nevertheless tapped
the screen a few times in defiance. The console did nothing, save for
emit a dull bleep, further enforcing its rejection.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“My accelerator has
been locked,” Dodds said. “If yours isn't working either, then
we'll have to do this the
old-fashioned way.” Estelle said nothing and Dodds returned his
full attention back towards their target, discovering the reasons for
her sudden silence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
A large explosion
appeared at the stern of the Imperial frigate, followed by another.
The vessel began to come apart, venting gases and chemicals, and
trailing chunks of hull and bulkhead in its wake. An enormous hail of
cannon fire came from somewhere behind, slamming into the stricken
vessel and putting an end to its involvement in the battle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hawke,” Estelle
said, as <I>Ifrit</I>
came into view.</P>

With Rissard next to
him, Zackaria watched the destruction of the two frigates in silence,
their short-lived victory coming to a swift end. He turned and
signalled to the crew that they were to leave at once. He felt no
disappointment over their loss, nor in the direction the battle had
turned. He had gained considerable knowledge and insight into his
enemy; experience that would prove invaluable in the future.</P>

Parks glowered,
observing a feed of the spinning remains of the second frigate. True
to his word, Hawke had engaged the enemy vessel as it had jumped into
position behind the three carriers, effecting a flank. Hawke's
belief that the enemy might attempt such a manoeuvre had come to a
head, and he had made good on his own proposal to await such a move
and step in to undo it. Parks couldn't fault him for that.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He looked back to
another feed of two ATAFs chasing after the wing of fighters that had
arrived with the frigate. The fighters were pulling away from the
battle, heading back towards <I>Dragon</I>.
Likewise, another group were retreating from the three ATAFs that had
taken down the first frigate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>Griffin</I>,
this is de Winter. Enemy forces appear to be withdrawing. Should we
pursue?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Stand down,” Parks
said. “Let them go. I don't
want anyone to throw their lives away needlessly.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
They did so, and as he
watched, <I>Dragon</I>
turned away from the allied forces. A jump point formed beyond, and
the battleship, along with the enormous squadrons of Imperial
starfighters, accelerated in, disappearing from sight. Though chatter
and noise still filled the bridge, Parks felt an ominous silence
descend upon him. It appeared that the danger had passed, yet he
continued to stare at the feed, expecting at any moment the mighty
vessel to reappear. It did not.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>Dragon</I>
has departed the system,” he heard from somewhere up the bridge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>It's
over</I>, Parks thought to himself. <I>Thank
God</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah, but it looks
like it left some of its babies behind,” a voice came. It sounded
like Enrique's.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks noted that some
of the Imperial fighters had not made it into the vicinity of <I>Dragon</I>
before it had departed the system. Unable to jump out of Aster, the
orphaned craft now looked to be stranded, and for a time they milled
around in the area once occupied by their allies. All of a sudden,
they changed their heading and began back towards the allied forces.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hey, they're
coming back,” Enrique said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The cameras tracking
the group began to pan faster.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“They're
coming back bloody quickly!” the pilot then added.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The fighters were
accelerating at an alarming rate, putting themselves on a collision
course with the three ATAFs that remained the furtherest out from the
allied forces.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“They're going to ram
us!” That was Chaz. “Get out the way!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Two of the ATAFs moved,
the remaining enemy forces shooting past them, several making
last-ditch attempts to collide. For a moment, it looked as though
their efforts had been in vain. Then came an explosion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks spun from the
video relay to the frontal viewport, where even without the feeds,
the fading burst was quite visible. A ripple of shock ran the length
of the bridge, gasps and curses filling the air. Shouts and cries
exploded from the various feeds and the other bridges, all intermixed
and indistinguishable, and none providing the one answer Parks
needed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What happened?”
Parks demanded, above the cries. “Someone tell me what the hell
just happened?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Collision, sir,”
Liu answered him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Between?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“One of ours and one
of theirs. It looks like both vessels have been destroyed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks paled. It had
been just as he had thought: the pilot had faltered, lingering too
long as they tried to decide the best direction to take, to best
avoid the dozen or so Imperial fighters that were speeding towards
them. In the end, one of the craft had ploughed straight into them.
For everything that had happened that day, this was by far the worst.
With the destruction of the ATAF, their one hope against the Enemy
had been dashed. Everything now seemed hopeless.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He stood staring out
the viewport. Seconds later, he shook the shock from his system,
remembering that several suicidal Imperial starfighters were still
racing toward the allied group.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Shoot them down!”
he shouted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
It did not prove
difficult to do so, the craft making no effort to deviate from their
course. Cannons from the line of allied vessels blazed, finally
putting an end to the battle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks looked back to
the two ATAFs that the cameras were still tracking, not far from
where the fateful collision had taken place. He caught a glimmer of
something as it emitted a faint glow. It appeared to be spinning over
and over. It took him a while to realise what it was he was looking
at.</P>

Kelly blinked her eyes
open and tried to clear her blurred vision. There was a jumble of
noise in her head. It sounded like voices calling out to her and
demanding attention. After sometime, she realised it was her craft
that was spinning and not her head, and with considerable effort she
managed to slow and halt the spin of the fighter, bringing it to a
complete stop.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Closing her eyes, she
concentrated on her breathing, calming herself so that she did not do
the unthinkable and vomit inside her helmet. What was going on? Where
was she? In a cockpit, to be sure. The act of slowing the fighter had
been somewhat instinctual.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She opened her eyes
once more and looked all about the cockpit, then to the nebulas that
hung nearby. A forest of spinning metals floated in every direction
the eye could see. What looked like the broken, burnt, and scorched
hull of some unknown large vessel tumbled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Kelly, are you
okay?” a dim voice asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
It seemed to come from
all around her. She winced against a dull ache on the left side of
her head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Kelly?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Where are you?
What's going on?” she said to the voice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You hit an Imperial
fighter,” the voice said. “It flew straight into you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It did?” Kelly
said. She found that hard to believe. If the voice was telling the
truth, shouldn't she be
dead? Maybe she was?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Kelly, are you
okay?” the voice said again. “Is anything broken? Are you
bleeding anywhere?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Enrique, give her a
moment,” another voice cut in. “It's
obvious she doesn't remember
what just happened. Kelly, it's Chaz. You've just had a crash. Don't
panic, just stay calm; ignore everyone and take your time. We're
right here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
For a time the voices
stopped and Kelly's memory
gradually began to rebuild itself as she looked about the cockpit and
at the scene outside. She started to recall the events that had led
up to her current situation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes... yes... I'm
okay,” she said, several minutes later. “I just can't remember
very much about what happened.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sounds like you
might be suffering from a concussion,” Chaz said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Kelly reached up to
touch the side of her head, before her hand encountered the helmet
she wore. Even so, she rubbed around the area where her head was
aching. She must have struck her head hard against the canopy. That
would explain the blackout. She still felt quite dizzy, but at least
the sick feeling was passing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“How's the ATAF?”
Enrique said. “Are you good to fly it?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah, I think so.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“How badly is it
damaged?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She pulled herself
together and looked at her read-outs. She squinted at the displays,
sceptical of the numbers she was reading and the images she was
looking at, thinking the blow to her head might be causing her to see
things.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It's not.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>At
all?</I>” Enrique said, sounding surprised.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No.” she said. She
might have been surprised if she had not been feeling so groggy.</P>

The report was relayed
to Parks, who started to wonder how many other surprises the day had
in store for them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“She's <I>alive</I>?”
Liu said. “After <I>that</I>?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks nodded to the
helmsman.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“By all rights that
fighter should have been destroyed and she should be dead! That's
incredible!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>It</I><I>'</I><I>s
more than that</I>, Parks thought. <I>It
may well represent our only hope</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With the departure of
the enemy forces and the silence of weaponry, the scene beyond the
bridge had become still once more. But amongst the multicoloured
splendour of their surroundings lay the remnants of a battle that had
not been easily won. With the operation over, Parks found himself
able to slow down and take in everything about him. He turned around.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The bridge had been
laid to waste; and whilst his crew were coping with the damage that
had been dealt it, <I>Griffin</I>
would without doubt be out of service for several weeks, if not
months. It was not time they could spare.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>Idiot,</I>
he thought to himself, looking over how much the carrier had suffered
at the hands of an enemy he had been foolish enough to believe he was
ready to tackle. <I>We</I><I>'</I><I>re
not ready yet! </I>You<I>
are not ready!</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>Leviathan</I>'s
condition was not much better, the damage to the
exterior quite clear from where Parks stood. The emblems of the
mythical creature that graced the hull were torn and burnt from where
missiles, plasma bolts, and lasers had scorched the armour. Small
glistening crystalline shapes could be seen emanating from damaged
areas, where leaking gases and chemicals froze in the cold. Loose
metals and alloys threatened to break off at the merest brush with
solar winds. <I>Grendel</I><I>'</I><I>s
Mother</I> told a similar story, the carrier in no
better condition for her part in the battle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
And then there was the
loss of <I>Grendel</I>.
The destruction of one of their carriers would not please the United
Naval Forces, who had agreed to support the Confederation in their
endeavour on the condition that the safety of their forces would be
made a top priority. Parks had a lot to answer for, though he
realised it could have been a lot worse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Good job, everyone,”
Parks said to the bridge crew, although the congratulatory offering
felt decidedly hollow. “Now that we have time to breathe, please
prioritise yourselves with seeing to the wounded and dealing with
repairs.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He would call a meeting
of his senior staff after he'd had time to see to other matters.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Mr Liu, please put
me in touch with <I>Leviathan</I>,
<I>Grendel</I><I>'</I><I>s
Mother</I>,
and...” he started, before a sudden anger gripped him. “No, wait,
disregard that. Put me in touch with <I>Ifrit</I>,
alone.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As he waited for the
link to establish, he tried to cool his anger by counting slowly to
ten. He made it to three.</P>

“<B STYLE="font-size:1.16em;">T</B>hank
you so much for your assistance, Commodore,” Parks began. “We
certainly would not have been able to cope without your timely
intervention.” Parks made no attempt to conceal the sarcasm in his
voice, the man sure that, even if <I>Ifrit</I>'s
captain had somehow failed to detect it, his expression would do an
adequate job of conveying his dissatisfaction.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Hawke's
expression in the holographic screen remained quite neutral as he
composed himself before replying. “As we had both agreed prior to
the commencement of the operation, Commodore, I took up the position
of rearguard and moved in to fulfil my role as needed. I stand by my
belief that had I acted sooner than was necessary, we would, without
a shadow of a doubt, have been surrounded by enemy forces and
certainly would not be having this conversation now.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That is beside the
point, Commodore!” Parks glared. “I gave you a very specific
request that our forces were being overrun and we needed your
support. You chose to ignore that request.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I did no such thing.
Your communication was cut short and I took it upon myself to hold
position until I could make a better assessment of the situation,”
Hawke replied with the same air of infallibility.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>Your
stubbornness and downright arrogance is staggering</I>,
Parks thought. <I>What
the hell happened to you?</I> It was almost as if the
man didn't <I>want</I>
to help. Had Hawke panicked in the face of the Enemy? Had a repressed
memory of his experience aboard <I>Dragon</I>
during the time of its theft reared its ugly head? Whatever it was,
it was still unacceptable to stand idly by as hostile forces tore the
allies apart, and for that Parks was infuriated. With all that had
happened that day he felt the rage building within him and decided to
end the discussion rather than make his feelings known to the entire
bridge crew.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We will continue
this later, during debriefing,” Parks said, fully intent on
bringing the man's almost
total lack of participation in the operation to the attention of
Fleet Admiral Turner and other members of naval high command.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He signalled to the
bridge crew to open communications to <I>Grendel</I><I>'</I><I>s
Mother</I> and <I>Leviathan</I>.
The holographic images of Mandeep and Meyers appeared alongside the
already present image of Hawke, the quality of the images as poor as
ever.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Commodore, Captain,”
Parks greeted them. “Are you in any need of assistance?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We will be fine for
the return journey, thank you, Commodore,” Mandeep replied, the
smile that Parks had grown so accustomed to and fond of no longer
gracing her face. “Much of the damage we received was superficial,
a miracle given what we just faced.” Mandeep looked sad and
disappointed, the tremendous losses they had suffered and the deaths
of her colleagues undoubtedly an enormous weight on her mind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Likewise with
<I>Leviathan</I>,”
Meyers said. “We did take some considerable damage, but it's
nothing that we cannot cope with prior to our return to Spirit.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks nodded in
understanding. “Very well. Whilst going about the repairs we should
perform a brief sweep of the area and pick up any bodies we can find.
Obviously there is nothing we can do for those poor individuals, but
we can at least return their bodies home for a decent burial.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
His eyes flickered past
the holographic images to the debris that floated about beyond the
carrier. Many of the starfighter pilots that had lost their lives
would have been all but vaporised in the explosions of their craft.
This he was glad for. After everything that had happened, too many
questions would be asked if they pulled in the body of one of the
Enemy. Such an occurrence would only act as a catalyst and foundation
for increasing rumour and speculation. A count and name-check of
those returning on the carriers would be performed at Spirit, with
those unaccounted for being marked as killed in action.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With that in mind, he
looked to Meyers. “Captain, can <I>Leviathan</I>
carry some of our fighters? Our flight deck is too badly damaged to
land any and we can only accommodate so many in our cargo holds. I
don't expect <I>Ifrit</I>
will have room to spare,” he added dryly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Meyers nodded. “That
shouldn't be an issue since,
regrettably, we have many empty bays.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Thank you, Captain,”
Parks said, before he turned once again to Mandeep. “Please convey
my sincere condolences to the families of those who were aboard
<I>Grendel</I>.
A lot of brave men and women lost their lives on that ship today.”
To lose an entire carrier was disastrous to any naval force. Matters
were made worse by the fact that the crew were made up of military
personnel volunteered by a number of Independent World naval forces.
Parks could almost hear the cracks widening in the already strained
relationships between some of the worlds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I will make sure
your sympathies are known, Commodore,” Mandeep said, the sadness
clear in her eyes even through the distortion. “Please contact us
when you are ready to leave. We will wait with you here, in case we
can provide any further assistance.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Thank you again,
Sima,” Parks said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Excuse me,
Commodore, but how do you suppose the enemy forces were able to
override the shutdown code that was sent to <I>Dragon</I>?”
Meyers asked. It was a question that had played on Parks' mind - and
he suspected very many others - throughout the course of the battle.
The sudden restoration of power to <I>Dragon</I>
had tipped the scales well in the enemy's
favour during the opening part of the operation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I don't
believe they did, Captain,” Parks answered. “Our initial attempt
at transmitting the code was not immediately successful and it took a
lot longer for <I>Dragon</I>'s
systems to be deactivated than I was led to believe. I was informed
that the shutdown procedure would take place upon receipt of the
code. The fact that it did not do so should have been our first
warning. It is my belief that the Enemy became aware our intentions
and purposely shut down all systems themselves in compliance. Once we
were lured into a false sense of security, they sprung their trap.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“How could they have
known about something like that?” Mandeep asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks had a hunch that
she was asking a rhetorical question, implying that the Enemy had
either been tipped off ahead of their encounter or that <I>Dragon</I>'s
previous crew were now working alongside its new owners.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm
afraid I don't know the
answer to that, Commodore,” he said. “Until we can collate a
battle report and analyse all the data, then my guess would be as
good as yours. Once we have further information I will ensure that it
is shared with the IWC.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Now, if there is no
other business that anyone wishes to discuss?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Even with the
interference caused by the damage to the holographic projection
systems, Parks had no trouble making out the subtle confrontational
look that Hawke was giving him. There were shakes of heads and
answers of no.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Then we will make
preparations to leave. I will be in contact shortly.”</P>

For the next hour the
allied forces continued with repairs, most of <I>Griffin</I>'s
surviving starfighters docking with <I>Leviathan</I>.
A sweep for bodies resulted in only a handful of recognisable
pick-ups, a mixture of both Confederation and Independent uniforms in
the group. The four remaining <I>Red
Devils</I> were found and taken aboard <I>Leviathan</I>,
the women identifiable by the colourful emblem of a cartoon devil
clutching a pitchfork on the left breast of their flight suits.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds watched the
shuttles do their work. He was happy to do nothing now but take a
well-earned breather. He listened to Estelle conversing with <I>Griffin</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Do you wish for us
to return to <I>Griffin</I>'s
cargo bay or should we dock with <I>Leviathan</I>?”
she asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Negative,
Lieutenant. I want you and your team to return to <I>Griffin</I>,”
Parks answered her. “Land via the rear cargo bay and then await
further instructions.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Acknowledged.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle was the first
to return to the rear cargo bay, the awaiting crew taxiing the sleek,
black starfighter back to its original position, so that the others
could land uninhibited. Dodds saw her waiting at the rear of the bay,
stood next to Enrique, as he landed. Even before he stepped out of
the fighter, he could make out the grin on the man's face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Good shooting out
there, mate,” Dodds said to Enrique, as he walked over to join
them. “Think I might have gotten one or two more than you, though!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I think you'll
find I was ahead of you the whole the time,” Enrique said, with a
chuckle. He shook Dodds' hand and they gave each other a hearty slap
on the back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That frigate still
only counts as one,” Dodds grinned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I am glad to be out
there, though,” Enrique said, nodding towards the ATAFs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Definitely. After
all of that I could do with a nap,” Dodds admitted. They looked to
Chaz, who was making his way over to them. He appeared quite upbeat
for a change, a smile on his face. With Kelly the last to land and
now out of her ATAF, the <I>Knights</I>
gathered around Estelle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Good work out there,
everyone,” she beamed, looking happier than she had done in weeks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I don't think those
Imperial pilots knew what hit them,” Dodds said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm
not sure anyone out there did either, to tell the truth,” Enrique
said. “Those fighters are still supposed to be a military secret.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Test run,” Chaz
said, glancing back around at the fighters, which still looked as
fresh and new as the day they had completed construction. There
didn't appear to be one dent or scratch on any of them. Not even on
the ATAF that Kelly had been piloting, having been hit head-on by the
suicidal Sphinx fighter pilot.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We should meet with
Commodore Parks for debriefing and then get you some medical
attention, Kelly,” Estelle said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Together, the <I>Knights</I>
started out the cargo bay. But as they approached, a number of
security personnel, standing by the hold's exit, gathered themselves
across the already-thin gap of the tall doors, blocking the five
pilots from exiting. At first, Dodds thought their presence was to
ensure the security of the bay and to escort the ATAF pilots to
Parks. Estelle attempted to pass. A halting hand was raised.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Something wrong?”
she asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sorry, but I can't
allow you to leave,” Omar Wyatt, <I>Griffin</I>'s
head of security, explained. “I have orders from Commodore Parks
that you are to remain here until further notice.” The man stood
ahead of the other members of his team who were each brandishing a
rifle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“But we must attend
our debriefing,” Estelle protested.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I have my orders,”
Wyatt said. “Commodore Parks feels that in the ship's
current state it would be best for you all to remain here.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Couldn't
you at least escort us to our quarters, instead?” Dodds said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“There is a member of
my team who requires some medical attention,” Estelle interjected,
nodding in Kelly's
direction, not waiting for the head of security to answer Dodds. The
man looked over at Kelly who, other than appearing to be a little
tired, displayed no signs of trauma or physical injury that required
any kind of urgent attention.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He shook his head. “No,
sorry. No-one is allowed in or out of the hold. And all our medical
teams are also busy dealing with those suffering from more severe
injuries.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle fumed and was
about to say something before Kelly stopped her, shaking her head.
Chaz did not seem in the least bit surprised by what was happening.
He swore, let out an audible sigh and then stalked off from the rest
of the group, settling down on the floor and propping himself up
against a rack of maintenance equipment. Dodds watched him for a bit,
but the big man did not acknowledge him or the gathering of people by
the exit. It was clear his short-lived upbeat demeanour had now been
pushed to the wayside and he would only sink back into silence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“All crew, this is
your captain speaking,” Parks'
voice came over the ship's
PA. “We are ready to make the return jump to Spirit. Please
finalise jump preparations.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle, Kelly and
Enrique wandered off to join Chaz, whilst Dodds made one last-ditch
attempt to leave the hold. “I need to take a leak,” he
threatened.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Then you'll
just have to go in your suit,” Wyatt answered with a shrug.</P>

Parks bid farewell to
Mandeep and watched as <I>Grendel</I><I>'</I><I>s
Mother</I> opened a jump point and exited the system,
the swirling jump point closing with the departure of the carrier.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Open a jump point to
Spirit,” Parks said to Liu.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir.” Liu
punched the required data into his console. Ahead of them the jump
point formed and, as before, when they had originally departed
Spirit, <I>Griffin</I>
started forward, followed by <I>Ifrit</I>
and <I>Leviathan</I>.
This time, however, Meyers and Hawke allowed a greater distance
between their carriers and Parks'.
If <I>Griffin</I>
suffered a power failure, they would have ample stopping distance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks, sat in the
captain's chair, just behind
the navigator and comms officer at the front, was drawn from his deep
thoughts by the flicker of something out of the frontal viewport. Had
something happened around the jump point? Something that wasn't
normal? Just as he thought he had imagined it, it happened again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
A streak of what
appeared to be lightning coursed its way right around the portal,
closely following its rotation. In its wake it left a jagged tear
that ripped open, revealing the colourful space behind it. The tear
then appeared to heal itself, leaving behind no evidence of the
abnormality that had grabbed Parks'
attention. He rose from his chair and wandered to the front of the
bridge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What was that?” he
asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Captain?” Liu
asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That... thing around
the jump point? It looked like lightning.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm sorry, sir, I
must have missed it.” Liu tapped at his console. “Systems are not
reporting any issues.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks began to wonder
if the injury to his head was preventing him from thinking and seeing
straight; though the stars were usually never that big or that shape.
He began to return to his seat, seeing that the portal had returned
to its normal state.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The portal, however,
did so for but only for a few seconds, before two smaller streaks
ripped through it just as the first, rupturing it in the same way.
Yet another and another appeared, tearing the pool in a similar
fashion, like a knife slashing a canvas. Pockets of intense white
light started to build in the region of the slashes, giving the
impression that the jump point was bleeding.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
None of it was sitting
right with Parks and the sight was now grabbing the attentions of
most of the bridge crew, their concern for the anomaly causing them
to leave their systems unattended.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Liu's
console began to whine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What's
that?” Parks said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sir, the jump point
appears to be collapsing!” Liu said, his hands darting across his
console. “I would strongly suggest we pull back.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Bring us to a halt,
Mr Liu! Cancel the jump request!” Parks ordered as <I>Griffin</I>
began to cross the threshold.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Liu attempted to
prevent the carrier's
further descent into the unstable jump point, but his efforts served
only to slow their advance rather than stop it. Moments later, the
frontal viewport was swallowed by the swirling mass and <I>Griffin</I>
hurtled forward.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>Griffin</I>
started to tumble, slow at first before it started to build up speed.
As the carrier began to shudder Parks ordered his crew to brace
themselves, before finding his own seat. He held on tight to the arm
rests, staring out at the usual sight before him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Whilst what the carrier
now travelled through bore many of the hallmarks of jump space, the
familiar blue haze was nowhere to be seen. Instead, <I>Griffin</I>
appeared to be surrounded by what looked like thick, blood-red
clouds. Angry streaks of electricity danced and crashed within them,
as <I>Griffin</I>
continued its journey into the unknown. The intensity of the
shuddering grew the further they seemed to plunge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Time appeared to slow.
Parks turned his head to look around the ship, his surroundings
somehow blurred. Everything appeared to be leaving translucent,
multicoloured trails behind them as they moved. It was like he was
drunk, stumbling down the neon jungle of one of Shai-Jin's tourist
traps, the bright lights of the city blinding and confusing his
vision.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Just as Parks thought
that the already damaged carrier would be torn apart, the shuddering
came to an abrupt end and, just like the blue haze of jump space, the
thundering red clouds parted gracefully to give way to normal space.
Stars came rushing towards them. Time returned to normal. The trails
faded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Everyone okay?”
Parks asked after Liu managed to bring the carrier under control,
following a bout of rapid tapping at his console's
controls. Parks did not hear the answers as he looked out into the
featureless void that lay all around them. It was in stark contrast
to the nebulas that had played host to the conflict zone they had
just departed, and Parks walked to the front of his ship to take
stock. There was not a single thing he recognised: no Temper, no
Spirit, no Aster, and no <I>Ifrit</I>
or <I>Leviathan</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He looked around at the
bridge crew, who had been following his gaze out the front of the
ship. “Where the hell are we?”</P>

“What's
going on?” Enrique asked Dodds as he returned from talking to one
of the security team.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“He doesn't
know,” Dodds said, settling back down on the floor next to the
others. “He assumes it's
just a result of the damage that <I>Griffin</I>
sustained during the battle.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I've
never felt a ship shake like that before.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It's
probably nothing to be concerned about,” Estelle muttered. Dodds
guessed that since being ordered to remain in the cargo hold, Estelle
was feeling as though she had once again been shot down in her prime.
With that in mind the others, with the exception of Kelly, were
largely ignoring her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I just want to get
out of here and get a shower,” Enrique started again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“And some food,”
Dodds added. “I can't
believe he wouldn't even let
me go out for a pi--”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Stop moaning you
two!” Estelle snapped. “We'll
get out of here in good time, so stop your griping. At least there's
nothing wrong with you. Oh, how are you feeling, Kelly?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Better now. The
dizziness has just about cleared,” Kelly said, still rubbing the
side of her head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We'll
get you some attention as soon as we get back to Spirit,” Estelle
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What did you think
of those Imperial pilots?” Enrique asked Dodds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“They were good. I
don't think we would have
stood much chance without the ATAFs, to tell you the truth.” Both
men turned to the innocent-looking starfighters that sat along the
walls of the cargo bay.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The crew that had
helped taxi the craft around and assisted the <I>Knights</I>
in departing their fighters were also sitting on the floor, looking
bored and frustrated. Some had wandered over to talk to the <I>Knights</I>,
but the security team had soon put a stop to their attempt at
socialising, fuelling Dodds' suspicions that Parks wished to keep
them apart from the rest of the ship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You're
right there,” Enrique said. “If that civil war does boil over and
they're all as good as
that...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, something wasn't
right there. They were <I>too</I>
good. You saw what they did to those other fighter pilots. Their
reactions were too fast and they were too accurate. They were tearing
those guys apart before we arrived.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Maybe they've
all got some kind of computer assistance?” Enrique offered.
“Something that was helping them to get the edge?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds noticed that
Chaz's head was tilted in
their direction, subtly eavesdropping in on their conversation.
“Yeah, something like that.”</P>

In one of <I>Griffin</I>'s
conference rooms, Parks sat down at an oval glass table with a number
of his senior staff. The wound on his head had been bandaged and he'd
given himself a general clean up while he charged Liu with finding
out where the carrier had emerged. Many of those present in the
conference room also wore reminders of the earlier conflict,
everything ranging from cuts and bruises, to arms in slings.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Following their arrival
into the unknown, Parks had requested they gather as much information
as possible pertaining to the unexpected events. He had then called a
meeting of the carrier's
heads of section.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Right, now that
we're all here: Mr Liu, could you please start by giving us an
overview of our current situation,” Parks requested of the man
sitting across the table from him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, captain,” Liu
nodded. He picked up a small hand-held device and tapped away at the
screen, prompting a large holographic projection to spring up in the
centre of the table, displaying a galactic map. It was cluttered with
somewhat excessive amounts of detail, highlighting trade routes,
jumpgates and points, as well as marking entire regions of space that
were a part of the Confederacy, and those that were declared
Independent. At one end of the map the Confederation star system of
Temper was highlighted and, at the other, the Independent system of
Aster.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Liu continued to tap
away at the device he held, dimming star systems and removing trade
routes, jumpgates and other pieces of data that were of no relevance.
Eventually, the Aster and Temper systems were left as the main focal
points of Liu's
presentation. He made some final adjustments, centring in on
<I>Griffin</I>'s
position on the map, located within the Aster system, and then began
to recount.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Following the
previous operation, we prepared to make the jump back to Spirit.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
A dotted line made its
way across the galactic map, from Aster back towards the Temper
system, illustrating his point.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“As we witnessed, the
jump point became unstable and we were unable to prevent our descent
within. The 'jump' we experienced threw <I>Griffin</I>'s
navicoms out of sync and it took them quite sometime before they were
able to establish a link with the nearest navigation buoy. If we
assume the data it has transmitted is accurate, then it appears we
arrived not back at Temper, but...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He tapped at the device
in hand. The galactic map zoomed out a long way, revealing yet more
star systems. The dotted line traced its way, not towards Temper, but
to a star system in the opposite direction to that which the carrier
had intended to travel.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“... here,” Liu
concluded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The section heads
gathered around the table gaped at the holographic display and the
highlighted star system that the line had traced itself toward. The
system was named Phylent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Phylent?” Parks
asked in total surprise.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir,” Liu
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We're
in Imperial space?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm afraid so, sir.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks'
gaze shot to the many windows of the conference room and to the space
outside that, thankfully, remained calm and uneventful. Even so,
there were mutterings and mumblings from the others at the table as
they stared in disbelief at the map. Parks'
mind raced. At this very moment in time, he and his ship were in the
one place that they did not want to be. He looked around those seated
at the table knowing that, whilst they were aware of the danger that
they faced, being in a part of space that was said to be embroiled in
civil war, none could confess to appreciating the danger more than
he. The failed operation to retake <I>Dragon</I>
had merely hinted at what the Confederacy and her allies were up
against, and had it not been for the ATAFs no-one would have returned
home after the battle. They had to get away from Imperial space as
soon as possible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
After a moment, Parks
regained his composure and turned his attention back to the meeting.
At this time, more than ever, he must maintain a cool, calm and
collected conduct.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He called for silence.
“How is that possible, Mr Liu?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I think that perhaps
Mr Marsh could explain in more detail?” Liu said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Heads turned to a
rather thickset man seated next to Liu, who straightened up. As
<I>Griffin</I>'s
chief engineer, Matthew Marsh was in a far better position to answer
Parks' question.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It seems that there
was a malfunction in the jump engines, most likely caused by the
damage we sustained during the battle,” Marsh began.
“Unfortunately, due to the nature of the issue it was not something
that we could have pinpointed until we attempted to use them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks scowled. It
sounded like a very weak excuse for such a serious issue.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Marsh added, “Our
pre-jump safety checks and individual unit tests reported no faults
and everything seemed to be working as expected.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“But it <I>didn</I><I>'</I><I>t</I>
work, did it, Mr Marsh?” Parks said, irritably.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, sir.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“When we get back to
Spirit, I want a full review of all jump safety checks. This could
have destroyed the ship and killed everyone aboard.” This was
directed at everyone within the room, though Marsh fidgeted as Parks'
eyes fell upon him. “How is it that we managed to get from here to
here so easily?” Parks asked after studying the galactic map for a
few moments, pointing from Aster to the Phylent system, that lay
close to the Imperial-Independent border.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Well, that is
actually quite interesting,” Marsh started, before back-pedalling
upon seeing Parks' stony face. “Er... I think that the malfunction
in the jump engines must have thrown some of the astral calculations
out. However, owing to some other factors we have successfully
compensated for those miscalculations. The jump computers selected a
cached version of one of Phylent's
navigation buoys as their destination and dropped us in a random part
of the system.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That actually fits
in with what I was thinking,” Liu said. “Phylent and Aster are
more or less equidistant from Spirit. Basically, we just went the
wrong way; albeit exceptionally fast.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks considered the
explanation for a moment. “Fine,” he said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“A shame we don't
know what the secret speed ingredient is,” Marsh started to babble.
“I have to say that I am actually amazed at the distance we managed
to cover in such a short space of time. I'm
planning on holding on to the data from the jump, so we can analyse
it once we return to Spirit. The findings could help to revolutionize
space travel and...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Put it in a report,”
Parks said, waving away the rest of the comment. Right now he was not
prepared to allow the man to indulge his knowledge and enthusiasm for
the inner workings of interstellar transportation. “And I think
you'll also find that the
secret ingredient you are searching for is just plain dumb luck, Mr
Marsh. By all rights this carrier should have been ripped apart.”
He looked back to <I>Griffin</I>'s
navigator. “Mr Liu, from here how long would it take for us to
return to Spirit?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Liu frowned. “Under
ideal circumstances? Roughly twelve, thirteen hours.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“And with the engines
in their current state?” Parks once again addressed the chief
engineer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I would say we are
looking at sixteen to twenty hours, if not a little longer,” Marsh
said. “However, the engines aren't in a state where we could safely
make another jump.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“And how long before
we can?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I've
not had enough time to estimate the cost of the damage to all the
dependent systems, sir.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks sighed. “I
realise that Mr Marsh, but I need the best answer you can give me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I would reckon
around nine hours.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks nodded as he
digested the information. They were looking at a time frame of more
than a day before they were back at Spirit. If the ATAFs had not been
aboard, he could have ordered they jump back to an Independent
system. But he knew that such a move was not an option, since that
could result in the discovery of the advanced starfighters by an
Independent World state. The Confederation were already hard-pressed
to keep the fighters under wraps, without dumping them in the middle
of a random system for anyone to gawk at. They would just have to
take their chances here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Okay,” Parks said
to Marsh. “Begin the work as soon as this meeting is over. Now, I
need the rest of you to find members of your respective teams who may
be able to lend their skills to repairs and maintenance. I shouldn't
need to reiterate to any of you that, in its current state, <I>Griffin</I>
is a sitting duck. Most of her major systems are operational, but
shielding is minimal and we have little in the way of offensive
measures. We are also unable to deploy what remains of our
starfighter complement easily; the cargo holds are simply not
equipped to launch fighters at the rate we'd need to fend off
attackers.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He thought of the cargo
holds. Whilst those holding the ATAFs contained nothing more than the
five fighters themselves, the others were crammed full of <I>Griffin</I>'s
starfighters. Deploying them in an emergency would be next to
impossible.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Those around the table
appeared to all be in agreement with his plan, their eyes drifting
from the holographic display, to the quiet space outside. The words
“Imperial Space”, “Phylent” and “Griffin” were far too
close together on the galactic map for anyone's
liking; especially his own.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks continued his
delegation. “I need a seventy-thirty split in duties for repairs to
the jump engines and repairs to the flight deck. It is vital that we
get out of this system and away from Imperial space as soon as
possible; but it is just as important that, in the highly likely
event that we are discovered by enemy forces, we are able to defend
ourselves.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir,” came
the resounding answer from those assembled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Lieutenant Weathers,
have you managed to contact either <I>Ifrit</I>
or <I>Leviathan</I>?”
he asked of a woman who was sitting further down the table.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Weathers, now working
as communications officer in place of O'Donnell, flipped through some
papers as she spoke. “We don't
believe that <I>Ifrit</I>
and <I>Leviathan</I>
are within range. It does not appear that they followed us into the
jump point and may not be aware of our current position. It is
unlikely that they were able to follow us either, given the unstable
nature of the jump point.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
It was as Parks had
suspected: they were on their own. “Very well. Is there anything
else?” Parks' query was met by head shakes and silence. “Then
let's get to work
immediately. We have a lot to do and very little time to spare. Get
moving, people.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As the staff officers
left, Parks noticed that Weathers was hovering, waiting for everyone
else to vacate the room.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, Lieutenant?”
he asked once they were alone.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“An encrypted
communication has come in from CSN HQ, sir.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“From HQ? Are you
sure?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir. It arrived
just before the meeting.” Weathers seemed as surprised as he was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Thank you,
Lieutenant. I'll take it in my private office.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Weathers nodded and
left Parks to ponder the speed at which the Confederation Stellar
Navy had succeeded in pinpointing his location, so soon after their
recent accident.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">

Compared to the rest of
the ship, Parks' private office was far more lavishly decorated. Wood
panelling covered much of the cold, grey steel and a number of
colourful ornaments were scattered here and there. A handful of small
paintings hung on the walls, depicting <I>Griffin</I>
and other vessels. Parks' eyes strayed to the painting of <I>Dragon</I>
as
he made his way to his desk and the commodore
caught himself wondering of how different things might have been had
their mission been a success.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Activating the computer
screen at his desk, he saw the CSN message. The screen read,</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:center;">
Encrypted Message
Received</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:center;">
FTAO: Commodore Elliott
F. Parks</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
On either side of the
greeting resided an image of a padlock, further emphasising that the
message was secured. Parks tapped “Read” with his finger tip and
was duly challenged to authentic his identity to the system,
prompting him for a password, iris scan, and voice recognition. Both
the iris scan and voice recognition took a number of attempts to
verify. It appeared the system was still suffering. After a time, the
message playback started.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I hope this message
finds you well, Elliott,” a grating voice began.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks was stunned to
see that he was looking at a video recorded by Admiral Turner. The
picture and audio were suffering; he guessed it was a result of the
damage to <I>Griffin</I>,
rather than the message itself. He moved closer to the display, to
listen carefully to what the Fleet Admiral had to say: right now, he
could do with all the advice he could get.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Turner went on. “After
you failed to return to Spirit with Commodore Hawke or Captain
Meyers, we immediately began a galaxy-wide sweep. Luckily for us, it
did not take very long to locate you. Since you arrived within a
formerly inhabited Imperial system, we were able to detect <I>Griffin</I>
quite quickly. In case you do not already know, you are in the
Phylent system, close to the Imperial-Independent border.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“First of all, do not
concern yourself with the outcome of your mission to retake <I>Dragon</I>.
We both knew that this was never going to be an easy task to
accomplish, and once again we have both been given a truly unpleasant
reminder of the kind of enemy we are up against.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks was in total
agreement. He recalled how, when he had mentioned the appearance of
<I>Dragon</I> within
Independent World space and his plans to ambush and retake the
massive battleship, the admiral had warned him of the risks. Though
the admiral had given him his full backing at the time, Parks wished
he hadn't been so hasty.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Secondly, I
understand that <I>Griffin</I>
has been heavily damaged in battle,” the video message continued.
“I have dispatched Meyers to your position, along with a number of
repair and medical vessels. They will not be with you for several
hours yet, so I need you and your boys to sit tight. Imperial space
is certainly not a place you wish to find yourself adrift and
defenceless.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I shouldn't
have to remind you either that whilst you are close to Independent
World space, there will be no help coming from those frontier
systems, since you should be more than aware that they have already
been evacuated. Even if they could help, there would be great
reluctance to do so, given the tremendous loss of life resulting from
the destruction of the carrier support they laid on for us. I advise
that we not seek to involve the UNF any further at this point. So,
until Meyers arrives you're
on your own out there and will just have to wait it out.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks nodded once more,
relieved to hear that Meyers would soon be there to assist them. He
then noticed Turner sit more upright, leaning forward in his chair.
Parks had seen that look on the man's face before; he swallowed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“But having said
that, your current location could not be more convenient. Regarding
matters within the Temper system some seventy-two hours ago:
intelligence have managed to locate the raider who fled the <I>Cardinal</I>
just before its destruction and discovered him to be travelling
around the Imperial frontier systems. He arrived in Phylent sometime
ago, so it's likely he won't be hanging around too much longer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Special agent Barber
has followed the man to Arlos starport, where he has been attempting
to offload various items of his <I>stock</I>.
This whole thing could have ended up as a wild goose chase, which
would have been all the better for us, but unfortunately Barber has
confirmed to me that the man does indeed have the entire dump of
<I>Cardinal</I><I>'</I><I>s</I>
databanks in his possession. And that means he has the ATAF plans.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“At least we now know
he has them and they haven't
already fallen into unwanted hands. Right now, he is struggling to
find a buyer and Barber is currently attempting to verify whether he
has them about his person or has stowed them some place else.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“She planned to make
her own way back to Confederation space once she has secured the
data, but I imagine this
could prove a lot trickier than she thinks. And that's
not a gamble I'm willing to take. I don't
know whether to call your accidental winding up in the Phylent system
luck or fate, but I know that we need to get those plans back, ASAP.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks was getting a bad
feeling about what the admiral was about to suggest. He began
scratching at the stubble on his chin as Turner's
request continued to unfold.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Therefore, I will
need you to bring her home with you or, at the very least, the data.
If you cannot bring her, don't
worry. You and I both know she is more than capable of getting out of
there herself. I would rather this is done whilst you await the
arrival of Meyers, so you can depart the Phylent system as quickly as
possible. We cannot risk losing yet another of our most powerful
weapons to the Enemy and as such this should now be your number one
priority. I'm sure that I
shouldn't have to remind you
that those plans are worth far more than every life on that ship.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks groaned as the
admiral's request set him on very awkward footing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“This may be an
opportunity to kill two birds with one stone, Elliott. We can gain
twice from this situation. With the <I>Red
Devils</I> dead, we have to play catch up and an
opportunity like this may not come by again any time soon, if ever. I
have taken the liberty of transmitting the coordinates of Arlos
starport to you, as well as extended intelligence concerning the
Phylent system. I'm hoping
you have all the information you need, since I do not recommend that
you respond to this message. Although we still have a handful of comm
relay points secreted around Imperial frontier systems,
communications fed through subspace are minimal. Any increase in the
tachyon streams could expose you to hostile tracking systems.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Just as Parks began to
wonder what had happened to Hawke in all of this, Turner answered his
question.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“As for Commodore
Hawke, he is much closer to your location than Meyers is. When he saw
<I>Griffin</I>
disappear into the jump point, with no clue as to your destination,
Hawke took it upon himself to assume command. He ordered Meyers to
return to Spirit to search for you there, whilst he took <I>Ifrit</I>
to search all the star systems adjacent to Aster. He, like Meyers, is
aware of your situation and that I have requested you perform a
little errand for us before you are ready to return home. Neither of
them, however, are privy to the full details of that errand, as I'm
sure you can appreciate. Unless he runs into difficulties, or
delivery of my instructions are delayed, you should expect Hawke to
arrive at your location sooner than Meyers. If you are able, you
should return to Spirit with him. Don't
wait for Meyers, he will understand that you had to leave as soon as
you were able. In such an event, we will let him know that you have
been found and are returning home.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“There is more
information attached in the brief I have included with this message.
You will need to relay this information to the <I>Knights</I>.
I realise that it does not paint the rosiest of pictures, but we need
to make sure our bases are covered for all eventualities.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Take care of
yourself, Elliott. We'll see
you soon,” Turner concluded. The message playback ended, and the
screen displayed a number of icons, detailing the additional
information that Turner had transmitted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks sighed. At least
one of his questions had been answered: the Confederation's
comm points had sent information about <I>Griffin</I>'s
arrival in the system back to CSN HQ, via subspace channels - Turner
had sent a message to the carrier in the same way. Though messages
travelled far quicker through jump space than ships themselves, Parks
was willing to bet that <I>Griffin</I>'s most recent jump would give
them a run for their money.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He stood up and paced
beside the window. He knew what he had to do and didn't like it one
bit. As the admiral had said, the ATAF plans were far more important
than all of the lives aboard <I>Griffin</I>
- in fact, more so than <I>Griffin</I>,
<I>Ifrit</I>
and <I>Leviathan</I>
combined - and that fact terrified him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He stared out the
window at the endless void of space. Now that the blast screens had
come down from the carrier's
windows, Parks was able to make out a dull grey planet hanging all
alone, not too far off. He did not need to consult a system map to
know that that was where Turner needed him to go.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Dammit,” he said
in a low voice, placing a fist on the window and leaning against the
glass. “There <I>must</I>
be another way; there has to be a way for Barber to come to me,
instead of <I>us</I>
having to go to <I>her</I>.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He racked his brains,
giving full consideration to every possibility that he could think
of, all the while staring towards the dull grey planet. But his
attempts to find a workable solution all hit dead ends. Turner was
right: he had little choice in the matter, and whether he liked it or
not he was going to have to send the <I>ATAFs</I>
and the <I>Knights</I>
to Arlos alone, and leave <I>Griffin</I>
all but defenceless. And the sooner that was
done, the sooner they could all get home.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With his mind made up,
he turned back to the console and closed the message, before rounding
his desk and striding out the door to make for the bridge.</P>

continued watching the security team that guarded the entrance to the
cargo bay. He had noticed a new face arrive earlier. The head of the
security team had exchanged some brief words with the man before the
pair had departed together. It did not seem to Chaz that anyone else
had noticed; little details such as that were apparently lost on
them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle was staring at
the floor, looking quite glum, though he suspected that her current
state owed more to sorrow than to being restricted to the hold.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“... gonna be a lot
of weeping mothers after this one, I can tell ya,” one of the
team's conversations had
carried to the hold's
current occupants.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Tell me about it.
They pulled out this one girl who had been buried under a collapsed
ceiling. Legs were a complete mess. Even if she'd
lived through that, she certainly wouldn't
be using those again.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Not sure I'd
take that over being spaced, myself.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Nice looking thing,
too.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That's
a shame.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz had noticed
Estelle's expression change
as the two men had spoken, the woman lowering her gaze to the floor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You all right,
Estelle?” Dodds had asked sometime later.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Just thinking.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sure?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Okay.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Thanks, Simon.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Simon. That was a name
he didn't hear used all too often.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The head of security
was now back, and speaking with the rest of his team. As he did so,
he looked around the groups of people sat in the cargo hold, but
mostly at the <I>Knights</I>.
The other members of the security team were doing likewise. It was
clear to Chaz that the man was discussing the <I>Knights</I>
and he'd guessed what was going on well before Wyatt strode over to
the five pilots.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Lieutenant de
Winter?” Wyatt asked as he stood over them, flanked by two others
from his team.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes,” Estelle
said, getting to her feet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Commodore Parks
wishes to speak to you immediately in his private office. Please come
with me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The <I>Knights</I>
were escorted from the cargo hold by the head of the security team.
As they walked through <I>Griffin</I>'s
decks towards Parks' office,
they were at last able to see the true extent of the damage. There
were still many safety and fire doors closed across every deck and as
a result their journey was not straightforward. Parks had insisted
that the security team avoid the use of elevators, in case they
became stuck and delayed the meeting.</P>

Parks turned back from
where he was gazing out the window in the direction of Arlos as the
six people entered his office.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Thank you for being
so prompt, Omar,” he said. “Please wait outside. I have a
confidential matter I need to discuss with the <I>White
Knights</I>.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir,” Wyatt
nodded and departed the office.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>White
Knights</I> reporting as...” Estelle began, before
Parks waved her down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“At ease. Please
excuse me for restricting you to the cargo hold. I intended to
explain the reasons behind the move back at Spirit, but that is going
to have to wait. You may have noticed that we are currently not in
jump.” He indicated to the inky-blackness of the world outside the
carrier, the scene punctuated by tiny pinpricks of greys and whites
from distant stars. “When we departed Aster, <I>Griffin</I>
suffered a miss-jump and as a result we did not make it to our
intended destination. Instead, we have become temporarily stranded in
the Phylent system.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Phylent?” Estelle
and Kelly both said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We're
in Imperial space?” Chaz asked, mimicking Parks'
own reaction to the news the first time that he had heard it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks nodded. “That's
correct, and we will be remaining here until we either repair our
jump engines, Captain Meyers or Commodore Hawke arrive to assist us,
or we are discovered by hostile forces. The situation is not in the
least favourable to <I>Griffin</I>
from whatever angle you look at it. Whilst rescue is on the way, we
cannot count on its arrival for at least several more hours.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>Griffin</I>
has sustained a considerable amount of damage and in the face of an
attack would be almost totally defenceless. Our weapon systems are
unreliable, our shielding is barely adequate, and we have no means of
launching fighters.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Excuse me, sir, but
we could launch the ATAFs from the cargo hold,” Estelle chipped in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Thank you for
letting me know that, Lieutenant,” Parks answered with a hint of
sarcasm. “But the situation is no longer as straightforward as
that, and I have just received a communication from Fleet Admiral
Turner that has further complicated matters. I believe you were all
present when <I>CSN
Cardinal</I> was boarded and destroyed by a raiding
party?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir,” Estelle
said, the others nodding.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We believe that the
raider who escaped stole some highly classified and sensitive data
that, if it were to fall into enemy hands, could spell utter disaster
for the Confederation and all her interests.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What was it?”
Enrique asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“As already stated,
Mr Todd, that is classified,” Parks shot. “Now keep that big
mouth of yours shut. This is very important and I need you all to
listen very carefully.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Enrique did so.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks pressed on. “All
you need to know is that we have to get it back. As it happens, a
government service agent has tracked the raider to this very system
and is in the process of reacquiring the data. She planned to
immediately return to Confederation space once she had done so, but
the instability of this entire region could make that considerably
more difficult than she first expected. And it is that which has made
my next decision so very difficult because I need you five to go and
get it from her.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He scanned the group as
he finished speaking, noticing, as he had expected, Chaz's
narrowed eyes upon him. The others said nothing, turning to look at
one another. Parks pressed on, looking to head off the two dozen
questions he could see coming. “So, I will be requiring you to
travel, in the ATAFs, to Arlos starport, where you will meet the
agent, retrieve the stolen data card that was her mission target and
return to <I>Griffin</I>.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
It sounded very simple
when Parks put it that way. He only wished that it was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He tapped the keyboard
in front him. “This is who you will be looking for.” Parks turned
the monitor of his desk around to face the <I>Knights</I>,
keeping a close eye on Chaz as he did so. Unlike the others, whose
attention was focused on the screen, studying the profile of the
woman they were to meet, Chaz's
eyes flickered to the monitor for only a couple of seconds before
darting back to meet Parks'.
For a while, the two men locked eyes, Parks maintaining a serious and
unwavering expression, Chaz keeping his own just as steady.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks said, “This is
Clare Barber, an agent working for the Confederate Secret Service.
She has a long-standing history of providing her government with
outstanding results.” He continued to lock looks with Chaz. None of
the others had picked up on the exchange, their eyes remaining
focused on the screen, which detailed Barber as being light-skinned,
thirty-nine years old, five foot nine inches tall, and with
shoulder-length, straight black hair.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“She's likely to be
maintaining a low profile, so you will need to put in a little extra
effort to find her when arriving at the starport. She is obviously
not aware of your coming to meet her, so do not expect her to come
running and waving her arms in the air the second you arrive. We are
aware that the Imperium has extensive information on some of our
operatives, so she will undoubtedly be on their watch list, due to
her persisted presence within their space.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He had still not broken
eye contact with Chaz.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I shouldn't
need to remind you all of the very hazardous predicament that we all
find ourselves in right now,” Parks said, before he swivelled the
screen back around. “And as such, it is necessary that upon leaving
<I>Griffin</I>
and travelling to the starport you take maximum precautions. That
means avoiding detection by hostile forces at all times.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle cleared her
throat, then said, “Pardon my ignorance, sir, but whilst they are
black, the ATAFs are not invisible.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You're
half right, Lieutenant. They are indeed black, and the cloaking
device fitted into each of the fighters is a feature we wished to
keep under wraps for as long as possible. However, circumstances like
these often force matters forward.” He paused for a moment to watch
their expressions, the look of total surprise clear on all of their
faces; his own deadly serious.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sorry, sir. Did you
say a cloaking device?” Dodds said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, Lieutenant, I
did. And it is exactly what you likely believe it to be: a system
designed to render the fighter totally undetectable by almost any
means,” Parks said. Now that he had their total and undivided
attention, he went on to explain the activation and features of the
device. The system would render the ATAF completely invisible to both
the naked eye and all radar systems, with the exception of those
on-board the ATAFs themselves. Even the glow of the engines would be
effectively masked by the device.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“The invisibility
effect of the cloak itself is linked to the ATAFs'
shields, so they must be enabled at all times, even when you
disembark upon entering the port. I want to make it absolutely clear
right now that if you disengage the cloak or the shields then you
will expose yourselves and blow your cover. You will therefore have
to push yourselves back through the shield when you wish to re-enter
the fighters, a tedious but elementary exercise as you all should
know.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You should also know
that although you can use your weapons whilst the system is
activated, it is not recommended as it will have detrimental effects
on your cloak. Should you do so, then your shielding will react for a
few seconds and light you up like a Christmas tree. Similar effects
will be caused by anything that tests your shields to any degree.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Unfortunately, I'm
not a scientist, so I cannot list every conceivable failing of the
device. But since you are not to engage any hostile forces at all, I
would strongly advise against using any of your weapons whilst
cloaked. The technology is something that we do not wish anyone to
become aware of – whether allied or enemy - and that means not
de-activating the cloak for any reason whilst you are proceeding with
this mission.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Now: do you all
fully understand me?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir,” the
five mumbled.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>What?</I>”
Parks said. It had been a lengthy brief, but he needed to ensure they
were all still very much awake.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sir, yes, sir!”
they repeated much louder, though with the exception of Chaz.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Excellent.” Parks
tapped at the screen before him and Omar Wyatt re-entered his office,
coming to stand by the <I>Knights</I>.
“de Winter, Dodds, I want you two to remain here for a moment
whilst I discuss some extra details with you. The rest of you head
back down to the cargo hold. I have already made the flight team down
there aware of my plans and they should have almost completed
preparations by the time you return. Dismissed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The head of security
led the other three out. Parks watched them go, Chaz meeting his eyes
for one last time before he left the office.</P>

Dodds watched as the
commodore rose from his chair and paced back and forth in front of
his office window for a moment, the grey and uninviting form of Arlos
just visible to one side of his view. He began contemplating why
Parks may have requested he and Estelle remain behind. Parks did not
take his eyes of either of them, studying them as if they were a pair
of wanted criminals he had chased for years, having at last been
brought before him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks stopped his
pacing and fixed him with a stern look. “I don't
suppose I need to ask if you're
sober now, Dodds?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Totally, sir,” he
said in earnest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“And I should damn
well think so, Lieutenant!” Parks snapped, his eyes narrow.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Despite his earlier
actions, it was very clear to Dodds that Parks did not feel he had
redeemed himself. Dodds detected that he was struggling with second
thoughts about sending the team away, unsupervised.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“When you get to the
starport I don't want any
performances from you, Dodds. You and Todd will fall in line behind
de Winter and follow the chain of command. You will do <I>exactly</I>
as you are ordered, without letting either your over-inflated ego or
have-a-go-hero attitude interfere with your assignment. Got that?”
He stabbed a finger onto his desk with each point he made.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir,” Dodds
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I want you to
understand that this is the most difficult decision I have ever had
to make in all of my career, if not my whole life,” Parks
continued, now looking to both Dodds and Estelle. “I am leaving my
ship and its entire crew defenceless, whilst I send you off on a
mission you were never trained for. I don't
want any of you to take unnecessary risks. Get into the starport,
identify yourselves to Barber, get the data card and return to
<I>Griffin</I>.
Nothing more. Am I making myself clear?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir,” they
both said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“de Winter,” Parks
said, his voice still lined with traces of anger. “Upon leaving
<I>Griffin</I>,
I want you and your team to position yourselves as close to the
underside of the carrier as you can before activating the cloak. This
will ensure that you are not seen by any of the crew and your close
proximity to the carrier will ensure you cannot be detected by the
radars. Do not move away from the carrier until you are all fully
cloaked. As I already stated, it is vital that we maintain secrecy
regarding the device - from both enemy and allied forces. Is that
understood?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir,” Estelle
answered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“On top of that,
Lieutenant, I am expecting you to keep this group together. I am
charging you with no less than the full responsibility of bringing
back not only that data card, but five ATAFs and five starfighter
pilots, as well. I want to make it absolutely clear that you are not
to return to <I>Griffin</I>
until you have the data card in your possession, or you can at least
reliably determine what has happened to it. If, after successfully
completing your mission, you return here only to discover that
<I>Griffin</I>
has been blown to pieces by hostile forces, you are to do nothing but
wait for Captain Meyers or Commodore Hawke to arrive in the system.
Even if <I>Griffin</I>
is nothing more than a burnt-out hulk you will not disengage your
cloak, engage hostile forces, or attempt to establish any contact
with non-Confederation vessels. You will hold position even if it
means waiting for your air to run out. Do not even make for any of
the jumpgates, since they will likely be swarming with hostile
forces. Am I making myself fully understood?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir,” Estelle
said again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
Dodds shifted his eyes
in Estelle's direction. He could hear in her voice that she was
starting to get frustrated. It was only sometime ago that she had led
her team to victory against Imperial forces, saving a great deal of
not only Confederation lives, but also those of the allied United
Naval Forces. Even so, she had not been allowed to be debriefed and
receive the congratulations and thanks she merited. Instead, she had
been stuffed into a cargo hold and been made to sit and wait. And now
she was being shouted at. Dodds felt for her; she deserved the
praise.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks, however, seemed
satisfied that he was being taken seriously and that he could trust
the <I>Knights</I>.
He relaxed his tone somewhat and asked the pair if they were clear on
what they were looking for and what they had to do.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
After he had finalized
all the details, Parks said, “I should also let you know that
neither Commodore Hawke or Captain Meyers are aware that the ATAFs
have cloaking abilities and, circumstances notwithstanding, I'd
like it to remain that way. The details of your 'errand' are also
classified and you should refer either the commodore or the captain
to Admiral Turner if they need to know what you have been doing. Now,
do you have any other questions?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sir,” Dodds began,
before pausing to consider his question. “Er... some of the ATAF's
weaponry is not active. Are there any other systems that may not be
operational that we may need to know about ahead of our task?” He
was aware that the question might be just the sort that could enrage
the commodore.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“If you're
referring to the plasma accelerators, Dodds, then this is
intentional. There was an agreement made prior to the beginning of
<I>Operation
Menelaus</I> that no beam weapons or torpedoes would be
directed at <I>Dragon</I>.
This agreement was in place to ensure that we could retake the
battleship without causing it critical or irrecoverable damage. But
no, there are no other features of the fighter that you need to be
aware of. Now, if that is all?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir,” Estelle
said, whilst Dodds nodded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Good. Now get down
to the cargo hold and get going. There is not much time to spare.
Security will escort you back down. Dismissed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds and Estelle
started out of Parks' office
and caught his last words to them as the doors opened.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Good luck, <I>Knights</I>.
I'll meet you upon your return to <I>Griffin</I>.”</P>

A little way from where
Dodds and Enrique stood, Estelle ascended the ladder into her ATAF,
just as they had all done only a few hours earlier, crew milling
around to make preparations for her departure. As Kelly was beckoned
forward to board her fighter and perform safety checks, Enrique
sensed Dodds lean over in his direction.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Doesn't this strike
you as weird?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“How do you mean?”
Enrique asked, keeping his voice low as Dodds had done.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That starfighter is
monstrously powerful compared to the anything else I have ever seen.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Of course it is –
it's the next generation of fighter.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds shook his head
and leaned closer. “Mate, listen: it took just <I>three</I>
of these things to take down an Imperial frigate; Kelly had a head-on
collision with a heavy-class Imperial fighter. That thing was blown
to pieces but there isn't one single, tiny little scratch on her
ATAF; and now we're being
told that these things can <I>cloak</I>? I mean, don't
you see? You don't build
something like this for no reason. This is a lot more significant
than just the next generation of fighter. What the hell is going on?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Enrique thought about
it for a moment, then shrugged. “Dunno, man. We'll probably find
out a little later on.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'd rather know
sooner. There's something about all this that doesn't feel right.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The pair stood in
silence for a while, watching as Kelly affixed her helmet and the
ladder was wheeled away from the side of the craft. Dodds was then
called forward to prepare for takeoff, leaving just Chaz and Enrique
together on the cargo bay floor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You okay?” Enrique
asked the big man, as Estelle taxied forward.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Will be once this is
all over,” Chaz replied.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Enrique noted the usual
enthusiastic tone in his voice. “Shouldn't
be more than a few more hours,” he said. “Let's say, four hours
there, one hour to find that spy, four hours back. Then we can
relax.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz said nothing, the
air about him somehow deader than ever.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:center;">

<P CLASS="western">

</P>
<P CLASS="western">
“So, let me get this
straight,” Enrique was saying, his voice coming in through Dodds'
intercom. “We have to go and rescue a spy? Shouldn't
those guys be able to look after themselves?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Agent,” Kelly
corrected him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As ordered by Parks,
the <I>Knights</I>
had positioned themselves beneath <I>Griffin</I>,
the starfighters not a few meters from the underbelly of the vessel.
Just ahead of them hung the small, grey, uninspiring planet that was
their destination.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds felt an
unwelcoming vibe coming from it and thought it not a place that would
traditionally be home to a starport. As he had positioned himself
underneath the carrier and awaited Enrique and Chaz to join the
others already there, he had studied the overview of the Phylent
system on his starfighter's
computer, discovering it to be home to a number of asteroid belts and
planets. For the most part, the system was uninhabited, though it was
rich in raw materials, minerals and other elements. It occurred to
him that the port would be favoured by those seeking their fortunes,
typically frequented by miners and entrepreneurs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
It made him think back
to the time before he had joined the Navy, when he had entertained
dreams of mining asteroids for their raw content. He had been talked
out of it by his father, who had told him horror stories of the
incredible hard work, long hours and many terrific accidents that
went hand in hand with such a lifestyle. He still sometimes wondered
if he may have managed to make enough money to retire after a couple
of decades of hard labour. It didn't have to be anywhere fancy, but
so long as he had enough cash to buy a bar on a laid back planet and
become the proprietor, he would be happy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Preparing to engage
cloak,” Estelle said, returning Dodds to reality.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Think it'll
work?” Enrique asked before their wing leader activated the system;
it was obvious he was leaving Estelle out of this particular
conversation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I heard about the
last time they tried something like this and how it all went horribly
wrong,” Kelly answered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It did?” said
Dodds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“If it does, then
she'll either end up several
hundred miles away from here or she'll
travel into the future.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That doesn't
sound too bad,” Enrique said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Before coming back a
few minutes later having either gone mad or become one with the
ship.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds said nothing and
just swallowed hard as Estelle activated the cloak. He found,
however, that there was nothing for any of them to fear: the cloak
worked just as Parks had described, and Estelle's
fighter faded gracefully from view. Whilst his ATAF's
radar could still detect and report the presence of an object in
place of where Estelle once appeared, he could see nothing else.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
After each of them had
tested the system for themselves, Estelle confirmed to Parks that
they had blanketed themselves from detection. Then, as one, the five
invisible ATAFs slipped out from beneath the carrier and set off
towards Arlos.</P>

amongst a huddled group of blanket-wrapped men and women, Daniel
Sullivan's
suspicions that he was being watched and followed had been confirmed.
A woman - he assumed it was, by the way she carried herself - also
wrapped in a blanket against the small chill of the starport, had
been hovering just out of sight for the last hour or so. The blanket
rested on the top of her head, the folds enclosing her and hiding her
face from sight. He was now aware that she had been tailing him as he
walked around the port, whilst he had been attempting to find someone
who was interested in his wares; his efforts so far having been met
with disinterest and the occasional outburst of anger from those
wishing to be left alone.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Usually the massive
central hall of the starport was bustling, filled with all kinds of
people: miners, resting from their labour; traders and couriers
seeking work and contracts; and many, many travellers. Bright,
animated signs, and warm inviting lights from coffee shops, pubs,
various food bars and trading posts lining the walls created a
welcoming ambience. Even in the most backwater star systems, the
familiar branding of intergalactic corporations provided the port's
guests with a sense of home and comfort.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Laughter and chatter no
longer filled the port, the signs of the shops were inanimate, and
the doors were locked, never to be reopened. Many of the windows of
the stores had been smashed and the contents looted. The central hall
had been transformed into a sea of people, settled on the floor, bags
and other personal belongings surrounding them. Young children lay
asleep, cuddled up to their parents.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Sullivan found that,
though the port was not bitterly cold, it could have been warmer.
Keeping warm could be achieved either by wrapping up, consuming hot
food and drink, or by moving around. The scarred man opted for
latter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Standing up, he began
to stride away from his stalker, partly to put distance between the
two of them and partly to get away from the place. Though he had only
arrived at the port hours earlier, he'd already had enough of Arlos
starport. It was time to move on and find another place to sell his
spoils. Perhaps he'd have better luck in the inner systems of the
Imperium; the frontier systems that he had visited so far had been
almost devoid of life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
In the grand scheme of
his chosen career he could be considered a petty thief. He found
smuggling, weapons trading and gang associations too much like hard
work, and there were too many risks involved. The boarding of the
vessel within Confederation space had been one of his biggest jobs in
recent years, working alongside an ad-hoc group of others he had met
in a dingy bar sometime ago. They had been useless, some succeeding
in getting themselves killed even before boarding the ship. He had
decided to cut his losses there and then, putting a round into the
back of the heads of the survivors, before rigging up booby traps and
fleeing with what he could.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
That had not been a
venture he had enjoyed; not something he was used to. Instead he
preferred to focus on the things that were easiest to carry and
dispose of, mostly stealing to order. The trades were quick, for the
most part effortless and low-key. Starports were his greatest outlet,
travellers and entrepreneurs being his best customers. Today,
however, Arlos had been a waste of time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He started back toward
the docking port he had left his ship in, with the intention of
heading to the nearest jumpgate and departing the system for greener
and more lucrative pastures. Although, for some reason he was having
difficulty making headway deeper into Imperial space. The navigation
buoys were oddly reluctant to provide him with the necessary data. He
would dig through his ship's
databanks and see if the previous owner, from whom he had so
violently separated it, could be of any more help.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Glancing over his
shoulder, he noticed that his pursuer had also risen and was once
again tailing him, although not as subtly this time as before. It was
not the first time he had been followed when he was trading, but
judging from the way the woman had kept her distance and her profile
low, she was not one of the usual suspects. At first, he had thought
her to be in the same line of work as he was, himself: some found it
easier to let someone like him do all the hard work and then pounce
on them in the middle of a transaction, relieving them of their
hard-earned goods. Parasites; he hated them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
But this woman was far
too cautious for that. He had dismissed the possibility that she was
a bounty hunter, chasing the reward money for either his head or
something he had stolen from the wrong person. If she had been, then
the pursuit would not have been such a slow, quiet affair - more
noisy, violent and very quick. No, this was a new one to him and he
could make few assumptions; though one thing he knew he could be
certain of was that the woman had decided it was time to come out of
hiding and was about to move in for the kill.</P>

Clare Barber swept
between the groups of people settled on the floor around her. She
watched her step as she did so, though she did not take her eyes off
her target, who walked now with a greater purpose than just the wish
to sell his haul and leave.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He still had the card,
though. She had heard him enquire a couple of times in the past hour
as to whether anyone would be interested in <I>buying
information</I>. They weren't, of course; these people only
wanted to get away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
It seemed to her that
the man was either far too ignorant or far too arrogant to appreciate
the terrible fate that had befallen the Imperium, and so it had come
as little surprise to her that he was having difficulties in
offloading his stock here. She thought it likely that he had, until
sometime ago, only operated in Confederation and Independent World
star systems, returning to Imperial space now after attracting too
much attention and needing to disappear for a while. If that was the
case, he was not having much luck escaping unwanted attention here,
either.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He stopped walking and
Barber, anticipating his next move, calmly reached inside the jacket
she wore beneath the blanket and removed a pistol from within. Her
finger clicked the safety off.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The man turned around,
his and Barber's eyes
meeting for the first time, his scowl telling her that he was not
happy with being followed. Many scars covered his face, showing many
permanent reminders of the cost of his chosen lifestyle. His eyes
seemed to tell terrible stories of all he had butchered whilst in the
pursuit of that path. He presented a look that would have had many
hastily reaching for their valuables, rather than incurring the pain
and violence promised. Barber was immune: she had seen many more
terrible things.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He sighed audibly
before speaking. “&lt;You've
been following me all day. Did you want to buy anything or is there
something else I can do for you?&gt;” His voice was calm and
smooth, his eyes still locked on Barber's.
He was playing with her, trying to throw her into a false sense of
security, pretending that he was not as threatening and dangerous as
his looks might suggest, giving her the chance to walk away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Though the man spoke in
an Imperial dialect, Barber knew that he would understand everything
she had to say to him. “You are carrying something I want,” she
said, with equal calm. The pistol she gripped emerged from between
the folds of the blanket that still enclosed her and she pointed it
casually at the man's chest.
“Hand over the data card. Nothing else, just the card. And do it
slowly.” Her other hand slipped the blanket from her shoulders,
letting it fall to the floor behind her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Though she had her
pistol in her hand, she was not about to approach and frisk the man
herself. Her experience with people such as this raider had taught
her that they could be slippery characters, unpredictable and
desperate, and either very cunning or very stupid. It mattered little
to Barber which of those he might be, since, no matter what, she
could be certain he would be very dangerous.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
At the sight of the
pistol, people close to the pair started shifting, shuffling backward
and clamouring to stand and escape the scene that was unfolding
before them. Despite the sudden goings-on about her, Barber did not
take her eyes off her target.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The man sneered,
watching the people gathering up their belongings and trying to get
loved ones to move out of the immediate area.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Barber's
face remained stern. “I won't
ask you again,” she warned. She could have shot him hours ago, but
had refrained from doing so in case of a defensive knee-jerk reaction
from one of those assembled in the immediate area, leading to her own
death. She could no longer risk that the man might get away, though,
and had taken the decision to confront him now.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The raider's
eyes widened, but his sneer remained. “Well, if you want it so
badly, why don't you just
come over here and take it?” he replied, reverting his dialect.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Barber straightened her
arm, training the gun on the man's
head, emphasising her point. The man's
sneer disappeared, his face becoming serious. He reached into the
coat he wore, his hand fumbling around in an inside pocket.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Barber tensed,
anticipating the glint of a firearm and the need for her to react.
The raider removed something and threw it at her feet, though it did
not make the noise she was expecting: much louder and clunkier, and
with a metallic clasping sound. The gasps and sudden cries about her
confirmed her worries. She took her eyes off the man for just a
moment to see, resting a little way in front of her, a tiny, flat
octagonal device. A red light winked on the top of its dark grey
surface, steadily growing faster and faster. It was a mini-mine, and
it was about to explode.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Barber ran back, trying
to keep an eye on the man as the device went off, fire, flames and
smoke obscuring her vision. Through the haze she sighted him,
sprinting between the packs of people crowded together on the floor.
Ignoring the screams of terror around her, Barber began a much more
urgent pursuit of her target. The raider was fast, darting between
groups and huddles, and hopping over bags, but Barber had few
problems in keeping up. She kept a tight grip on her pistol as she
ran, stopping every now and again to loose off a shot, none of which
found their mark. The long coat the man wore flapped around as he
zig-zagged, ducked and leapt about, concealing his form from her and
making it much harder to know where to shoot.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She chased him for
sometime and soon had him cornered, the exit he had been making for
unexpectedly closed. Barber had seen to that when she had followed
him in, intending on minimising possible escape routes. He hammered
at the button next to the exit, but it refused to open. She levelled
her gun at his torso as he tried in vain to prise the door open where
it met the wall, his fingers struggling to find anything to latch on
to.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Barber had chosen a
non-energy weapon for this assignment. Though an energy weapon was
more effective, within the context of this fight it could destroy the
data card she was after. Whilst she was aware that the impact of a
bullet could also damage or destroy the card, the high amounts of
energy dissipated by the impact of a plasma or other energy shot
could cause destruction by proximity. And bullets served Barber's
requirements just as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
At the last second,
just as Barber squeezed the trigger, the raider ducked along the side
of the adjoining wall, and the shot that had been intended for his
heart slammed instead into his left shoulder. Barber fired once
again, but with the raider still ducking the shot missed altogether,
ripping through his coat and ricochetting off against the wall behind
him. The third squeeze clicked on an empty chamber, the tiny digital
counter on the top of the weapon flashing two zeroes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Bitch! I'll
kill you!” her quarry cried out with a mixture of pain and anger,
his right hand clasped around his bleeding shoulder. Barber saw him
swing around and aim his own weapon. It looked like a laser pistol.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Barber ducked down
close to an assembled family, who panicked at the sudden realisation
they were now in the line of fire. The raider appeared to be
left-handed, or at least held the weapon with his left, and with his
shoulder wounded his aim was far from true. The first shot cleanly
missed its intended target, as well as everything else, the thin red
beam striking the floor behind Barber, letting off sparks and leaving
a scorch mark at the point of impact. The second and third shots
found targets, neither of which were Barber. The first felled a man,
hitting him square in the forehead. The beam passed straight through
his skull, leaving a small hole in the front and back of his head
before striking the ground behind. The second struck a mother in the
hand as she reached across to grab her daughter, and the little girl
screamed in horror as three severed fingers fell into her lap.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Following his
unsuccessful attempts to down his target, the raider lunged forward
with his outstretched right hand, and yanked a young woman up off the
floor by her long hair, just as Barber prepared to raise her gun once
more. The man held the screaming woman in front of himself, shaking
her head and shouting at her in the Imperial dialect he had spoken to
Barber in. At first, he placed his gun against the woman's temple,
before he lowered his quivering arm and rested it across her shoulder
for support.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Barber felt no pity for
the dead man or maimed woman, they were nothing more to her than
collateral damage. However, to shoot the innocent woman held by the
raider as a human shield went against her code of conduct and her own
moral values. Even though the Confederacy had pressed upon her the
tremendous importance of the data card she was after, there were some
things she refused to do.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The raider began
walking away, keeping parallel with the wall behind him as the girl
continued to sob with fear and plead with her captor. He kept an eye
on Barber the whole time, his laser pistol pointed over the shoulder
of his hostage. Barber sidestepped in his direction, keeping up with
his pace, her own gun trained on him the whole time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>Why
isn</I><I>'</I><I>t
he firing?</I> Barber wondered. <I>Is
he low on ammo? Has his laser pistol overheated?</I>
The man was in a far better position to attack than she was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The three continued
with their steady stepping dance for a while, the raider seeking to
move himself into a more strategic position from where he could flee
to the next docking port exit. He made occasional snap glances
around, to ensure he was not going to trip over items that were
scattered about. But as Barber already knew, his current location was
not going to permit him an easy escape route and it could be seen
that he was losing patience with the girl he was dragging along. His
wounded shoulder was also making it more difficult for him to keep
his arm straight, despite being able to rest it across the terrified
woman's shoulder. Barber
maintained a relaxed demeanour, following his every step.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The raider suddenly
cast aside his hostage and began to run, making no attempt to shoot.
Barber swore as she started after him. His gun had been empty the
whole time; he had been bluffing. And Barber had been doing just the
same thing. Neither of them had found the time to reload their
weapons and neither wanted to give the other the advantage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Barber broke into a run
to catch up with the raider, who was once again darting and skipping
over people. He was not heading in any specific direction, but
zig-zagging once more. Barber saw him fumbling around in his coat and
assumed he was trying to buy himself some time as he searched for an
energy capsule to recharge his laser pistol. With the huge scatters
of people and baggage, coupled with the urgency of the raider to
reload his gun, Barber could see it would not be long before he came
undone.</P>

As Sullivan leapt over
a bag, his foot became caught within an exposed, unturned strap, the
sudden and unexpected additional weight causing him to topple forward
and crash to the ground. His laser pistol and the energy cap he had
only just managed to pull from his coat clattered and skidded along
the floor ahead of him, far out of reach. He thrashed his foot around
in a vain attempt to free himself, not wanting to take his eyes off
his gun, though the struggling did him no good. He looked around at
the problem, and his hands flew towards the straps that were curled
around his ankle. His coat was equipped with a knife, built into one
sleeve, and with a quick flick of his wrist it shot free and into his
hand. It was exceptionally sharp, and with just a few slashes he
managed to cut away the straps.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Free once more, he
leapt to his feet, just in time to see his pursuer descending upon
him. There was a bang; she had wasted no time in shooting him square
in the chest. Sullivan grunted as the bullet slammed into him, but
despite the searing pain he still had a lot of fight left in him. He
responded to her attack by driving his knife into her own chest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah?! See how you
like it, bitch!” he spat. The woman cried out in pain, but even
before she had time to act Sullivan gripped her tight about the
shoulder, withdrew the knife and plunged it twice more into her. Just
as he prepared to strike for the fourth time, he heard several bangs
and the remainder of his attacker's clip tore into his belly. He
struggled to breathe, but could draw no air into his lungs. He held
fast to his knife, even as his vision blurred.</P>

The raider sagged, his
grip on Barber loosening as he fell to the floor. Barber could feel
her own legs beginning to give way and she fought to control herself.
As the raider lay dead on the floor before her, she rummaged through
his clothes. She prayed that he had the data card with him, rather
than having left it in his craft. In her current state she wouldn't
even be able to make it to the docking ports, let alone break into
his ship. She coughed as she continued her hasty search, tasting
blood in her mouth, seeing it splatter over the man and feeling it
run down her chin.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Relief washed over her
as her fingers encountered a thin piece of plastic which, once
removed, revealed itself to be just what she had been looking for: a
tiny, thin blue card, bearing the Confederation insignia. Her head
began to feel light and she sat down on the floor with a heavy thump,
using one hand to prop herself up and keep from tipping over
completely. There was very little time to act. She knew what she had
to do and, reaching into her jacket, she removed a packet containing
a tiny capsule and a small bottle of liquid. Breaking open the
packet, she placed the data card into the capsule and sealed it
tight. She coughed some more, feeling the blood fill her mouth again
and the taste of iron with it. She spat it from her mouth, as well as
the rest that wanted to follow.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
It took her some time
and considerable effort for her to achieve what she had planned for
the card, but eventually she succeeded. Drawing heavy, staggered
breaths, but confident that the plans were now in a safe place, she
lay back. She was going to die. She found her breath coming shorter
with each passing moment. The raider's knife must have punctured a
lung.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She noticed that some
of the more inquisitive witnesses to the scene were inching forward
to investigate the man and woman who had fallen down together in a
pool of blood, following their very violent encounter. She met
another woman's eyes and saw
them filled with pity.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I hope you're
luckier than I was,” she whispered. But in her heart she doubted
that. There was a good chance that she was the lucky one here.
Running would not save these people any more than fighting would.
They were only prolonging the inevitable. Eventually they would not
be able to run any further; although she could not blame them for
trying. And when they were caught, that would be it. Prisoners would
not be taken, lives would not be spared.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Barber's
vision became cloudy and the woman closed her eyes, letting the
darkness take her.</P>

<P CLASS="western">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">
<B STYLE="font-size:1.16em;">O</B>ver
time, the grey form of Arlos loomed steadily larger as the ATAFs
hurtled towards it, hidden from all but the most diligent observer
beneath the veil of the starfighter's
cloaking device. Owing to the direction of their approach, the
starport was obscured from the <I>White
Knights</I> behind the far side of
Arlos; and as he rounded the dull planet, Dodds expected to see a
flurry of activity from their dodecahedral-shaped destination.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Contrary to his
expectation, the starport was quiet and appeared to be all but
abandoned. The normal glow of lights and other illuminations that
would have welcomed travels were absent, the port's
lifelessness echoing that of the rest of the star system. He got the
feeling that the port wished to convey the impression that it had
been out of use for quite sometime, its previous residents having
upped and left many years ago.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
It was the second time
in almost as many days that Dodds'
destination had presented him with a cold and dead demeanour, and it
was a theme that was starting to become all too common. The only
indication that the port was not as dead and lifeless as it would
have had one believe was the presence of a solitary cargo vessel
resting near by; though it too was shrouded in darkness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Think anyone's
home?” Dodds asked of his companions as they came closer to their
destination.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Looks abandoned,”
Enrique said. “Either that or our friend has been busy here, too.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Estelle, are we in
the right place?” Dodds said with genuine uncertainty.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“These are the
coordinates that Commodore Parks gave us,” Estelle said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds' eyes flickered
over the surface of the port. Under normal circumstances, a starport
would be a hive of activity, its presence advertised far and wide by
the constant flow of traffic to and from it. Mining vessels,
transport ships of various shapes and sizes would be docked in and
around the port, dropping off passengers, cargo and spoils. Even
without the heavy flow of traffic, the port could be spotted from a
long way off, the bright multicoloured lights guiding people home.
All that was gone now, cold, uninviting grey steel the only thing
remaining to greet visitors.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I've just scanned
for a possible means of entry,” came Chaz's voice. “But it
appears all docking ports have been sealed. Looks like we're
going to have to find another way inside.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We'll
have to use an airlock,” Estelle said. “Which means we'll
have to leave the ATAFs outside the port.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We're
just going to leave them floating here?” Dodds said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We don't
have much choice in the matter. As Commodore Parks instructed, we'll
keep them cloaked whilst we retrieve the data from the agent.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sure. And then we'll
just fumble about in empty space looking for them when we come back
out,” Dodds said sarcastically. He could see no clear avenue to how
they were supposed to get back into the ATAFs once they had left
them. Since they were invisible, the <I>White
Knights</I> would have to grasp around in the
starfighter's general area
and try and feel their way back in the cockpit. But that could take
hours, maybe even days. Maybe even longer. Dodds hoped that they
would not be in a hurry. Taking any sort of mobile sensor device with
them was not an option, either. Whilst the ATAFs'
radars themselves displayed the positions of the other fighters,
cloaked or not, they were not removable from the craft.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We'll
have to turn the cloak off...” Dodds began.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>No</I>,
Dodds,” Estelle said. “We were given very specific orders by
Commodore Parks not to deactivate the cloak for any reason.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds said nothing else
on the subject, sensing that Estelle was still upset after being
chewed out by the commodore, despite averting <I>Operation
Menelaus</I> from becoming one of the greatest naval
catastrophes in recent history.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“One of us will have
to remain out here, then,” Enrique said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No-one is staying
out here alone,” Estelle said. “I want everyone to be where I can
see them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We'll
have to find some way of returning to the ATAFs once we leave them,
then,” Enrique responded. “Otherwise we might never find them
again.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“If we leave them
next to that freighter it'll be a lot easier to locate them,” Kelly
chirped up. “We'll have a
better point of reference.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That's
a good idea, Kelly,” Estelle said. “Okay people, let's
form a line close to the freighter and disembark. Once you're
out, make your way over to me.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The others acknowledged
her order and guided the ATAFs close to the freighter, watching their
radars and HUD so as not to collide with one another.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Bringing his ATAF to a
stop, Dodds informed the others he was disembarking. He
reached under the fighter's
seat and pulled out a small propulsion pack that resided beneath. The
pack was a standard feature of all the CSN's starfighters, though it
was only of any real use to the pilot during events such as
ejections. Dodds had received training in the usage and general
application of the pack, but he had never found the need to use it,
himself. Ensuring his helmet and flight suit
were securely set up and fastened, he opened the canopy. He unbuckled
himself from his seat and, taking a good grip of his propulsion pack,
let himself drift out into the vacuum.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
His flight suit was
well insulated against the cold of outer space and upon leaving the
ATAF he experienced nothing more than the sensation of free movement
within the vacuum. Dodds started slipping his propulsion pack onto
his back and, looking around, saw Enrique making his way from his own
ATAF. It was a bizarre sight to behold: from the middle of nowhere a
helmet emerged, followed by shoulders, a body, legs, and then feet.
It was as if a magical door had opened and his friend had just
slipped out of it. His pack on, he watched as the others left their
ATAFs, before Estelle's
voice sounded in his helmet's
speaker.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Over this way,
people,” she requested, raising her hand. She was waiting a little
further up the side of the freighter and the <I>Knights</I>
began to make their way over to her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We'll
make our way to the port and look for an airlock, so we can get
inside,” Estelle informed her team, once everyone had made it over.
“Follow my lead.”</P>

As she moved further
away from the freighter, Kelly took a look back. During their
approach, Kelly had stared at the vessel, very certain that she had
seen it before; or perhaps the blow to her head was making her see
things again. She had then scanned the ship with her ATAF's targeting
systems and the resulting readouts had once again made her question
her own sanity. Given the lack of comment from her wingmates, the
others had not noticed what she had.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
In large eroded and
rusted orange letters along the central container was the name of the
ship, “<I>La
Brabena Bella</I>”, and underneath it in much smaller
lettering, “Gloucester Enterprises”. The lettering was well-worn,
barely legible with little more than the outline remaining; but it
was readable if one knew what they were looking for.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Gloucester Enterprises,
one of the galaxy's most successful trading companies, was owned by
Kelly's family. This was one
of her father's ships. She
had thought it looked familiar when the <I>Knights</I>
had first approached it, and her fighter's computer had confirmed the
ship's configuration. The
vessel had been designated a new name (“<I>The
</I><I>Mayflower</I>”)
and universal identity signature, but there was no chance of
disguising its distinctive appearance from Kelly. The body was
segmented into three main parts, like a rigid snake that had
swallowed three large rectangular boxes. The lick of dark red paint
was also something of a giveaway.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>What's
it doing here, all the way out in the middle of nowhere?</I>
Kelly wondered. Despite its success and reputation throughout
Confederate and Independent systems, the Imperium had never granted
Gloucester Enterprises a trading permit; the Senate had seen to that.
It was unlikely to have been stolen, and she knew the company removed
all affiliated branding before selling off old ships. Something about
its presence here did not add up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She lingered for a
while, staring at it, contemplating a number of explanations. She was
about to say something to the others when her eye was caught by
something else: portholes and windows dotted the length of the
freighter at various points and from out of one of the windows a
small face was staring back at her. As Kelly squinted, it remained
there, transfixed, gazing back at her in wrapped, abject horror. It
was the grubby-looking face of a little girl, long, unkempt dirty
blonde hair dangling down around her head. Her mouth hung open, as if
she had just made a great intake of breath and was now too scared to
make any other noise or movement.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Kelly prepared to start
forward to the window when a new face appeared alongside the child.
It turned to glance at Kelly before it and the little girl vanished
from sight. From what Kelly caught, it looked like an older woman,
perhaps the girl's mother,
who had come to move the child away from the window. From the looks
of things, they were trying to conceal their presence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The surprise made her
gasp.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What's
up, Kelly?” Estelle's
voice came in her earpiece.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Kelly looked around to
see the others, now quite some way from her, had stopped their
journey towards the port. Had she just imagined it? No, she couldn't
have. The knock on her head did not appear to be doing her as much
harm as she thought; after all, she had been right about the
freighter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I just saw someone,”
Kelly answered Estelle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Where?” Estelle
asked, the three men next to her looking in all directions, as if
expecting to see a body swimming through space.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“In the freighter.
There was a girl, and a woman, in one of the windows.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Silence from the
others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“And?” It was
Dodds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That's one of my
father's ships,” Kelly insisted. “And they don't carry passengers
- it's a freighter.” Kelly saw that all four of her team mates were
staring in her direction. She guessed that they were peering past her
at the window, scrutinizing it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I don't see anyone,”
Estelle said eventually. “Are you certain you saw something?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She hesitated. “Pretty
sure. They didn't stay there long.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hey, wait. What's
one of your dad's ships doing out here?” Enrique asked. “That
doesn't sound right.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That's what I've
been saying,” Kelly said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Kelly heard Estelle let
out a tetchy sigh, then, “Look, we don't have time for this. Kelly,
did they look dangerous?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, they just looked
like civilians,” Kelly said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle mumbled
something offensive under her breath.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Right, that's all we
need to know. Now, get a move on and try to keep up,” Estelle said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Kelly tore herself away
from the window and started back towards the rest of the group.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">

<P CLASS="western">
“We need to find a
way inside. A service hatch or an airlock,” Estelle told the group
as they arrived next to the port's
outer surface. “Spread out and see what you can find. Call in if
you get into any trouble.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Even up close and
personal, the port was nothing but a mass of grey steel plates, the
occasional warning sign or instructional panel adding a tiny splash
of colour to the otherwise dull surface. The group set about on a
fruitless search for a while, discovering hatches and doors, none of
which could be opened.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Found one,” Dodds
eventually reported as he checked out a door close to the main
docking entrance to the port. Unlike the others, it was not security
locked. He pulled it open as the rest of the <I>Knights</I>
regrouped and joined him inside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With the outer door
sealed behind them, Dodds took a look at the control panel inside the
chamber and managed to re-pressurise it. He gratefully removed his
helmet and breathed in the air that now flowed into the small room.
He then worked the control panel some more, looking for a way to
grant them further access into the station. The inner door opened
and, as it did so, the group found themselves standing in a narrow
corridor. A number of men and women, sat along it, looked up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The sudden appearance
of the <I>Knights</I>
sent a ripple of shock down the line and a man close to the group
shot to his feet, screaming in terror. He stumbled and ran down the
corridor as fast as he could, pushing aside a woman who was also
trying to escape.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What the hell was
his problem? Did we spook him or something?” Dodds said, as they
watched the man who had leapt to his feet round a corner on his
continuing quest to escape whatever it was that had scared him. The
remainder crawled backwards down the corridor, eyes fixed on the five
people that had just entered the port, terror etched into all their
faces. It was as if they had just seen their worst nightmare step
through the airlock.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Beats me. Maybe he
thinks he owes Chaz money,” Enrique said, looking around at the big
man with amusement.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz said nothing, his
face stern and his eyes sweeping over the groups of people. “Let's
go,” he said, pushing the others gently aside and starting off down
the corridor. “We've got
to find Barber, get that data card, and get back to <I>Griffin</I>.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
A stunned Dodds watched
him go. He exchanged a confused look with Estelle, who was wearing
her own muddled expression. The people on either sides of Chaz backed
away as he passed them, the often silent man not giving them a second
glance. Dodds, Estelle and Kelly looked around at Enrique, who
shrugged.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hey, look: he might
talk to me more than anyone else, but that doesn't
mean that I know what goes on in that head of his,” Enrique said
almost inaudibly, not taking his eyes off the big man. “Don't go
expecting me to provide all the answers.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Come on,” Estelle
said, following Chaz down the corridor, passing by the people who
were now trying to crush themselves into the walls.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“&lt;Please don't
hurt us,&gt;” a woman pleaded as she tried to move further back
than the wall would allow.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What did she say?”
Dodds asked Enrique.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sounds like she was
speaking some sort of Imperial,” Enrique said, looking at the
woman.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Either of you guys
understand any Imperial dialects?” Dodds asked of Estelle and
Kelly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Just ignore them,”
Estelle said, striding around the corner and through a set of doors.
She stopped in the doorway, where Chaz had also stopped.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds walked up behind
the pair and peered around them. “Ah. We might be here a while.”
A sea of people lay before them, occupying almost every inch of floor
that could be found.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The five pilots stepped
into the central main hall of the starport, many heads snapping
around to take note of the new arrivals. Dodds noticed that the <I>White
Knights</I> received the same reaction from the groups
of people in the hall as they had done in the corridor, with many of
those close by pushing themselves further back. Some sprang to their
feet and moved away, appearing to not trust the new arrivals. It was
obvious that the man who had fled the corridor had passed through
here already, putting everyone on edge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You're
right, Dodds. Something's
spooked these guys pretty bad,” Kelly said as they began walking
aimlessly between the huddles, the search for Barber temporarily
forgotten. The people gathered about did not take their fearful eyes
off the <I>Knights</I>
for one second.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What's this all
about?” Dodds asked, looking all about the huddles of people. “Are
they all waiting for transit or something?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah, and what's
with all the bags? They look like refugees...” Enrique said. He
stopped walking.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds stopped and
turned to him. “Just like that guy said last night...” The
realisation of what he was looking at dawned on him. Links were
beginning to form from the conversation he now remembered. Refugees,
secret projects, genocide... “Didn't he say that the Empire had
been completely wiped out?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What are you two
talking about?” Kelly asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Last night, whilst
we were playing poker, this guy said that the Empire had been
destroyed, that the civil war actually ended years ago, and that all
that was left were a load of refugees.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“But... we just went
up against Imperial forces when we attempted to take back <I>Dragon</I>,”
Kelly said, appearing a little concerned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds shook his head.
“Those weren't them.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle's irate
demeanour appeared to have all but abandoned her for the time being.
She then scowled. “Wait, what are you talking about? Kelly's right.
Pay no attention to him. The Empire hasn't been <I>wiped
out</I>!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Estelle, you were
<I>there</I>! What
happened in that battle wasn't... well, it wasn't normal. I don't
know who they were, but those were <I>not</I>
Imperial pilots in those fighters. None of us would have survived
that battle if we'd not been in the ATAFs.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle folded her
arms, but did not argue with him further.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds couldn't shake
the feeling that he had his head in the lion's mouth. He looked again
at the groups of people on the ground, some meeting his eyes before
turning away, even those who looked as though they could handle
themselves. “We'd better
get on with this and get out of here,” he concluded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“How?” Enrique
said. “How are we going to be able to locate Barber amongst all
these people. She doesn't
know we're coming, and like
Parks said she's hardly
likely to be jumping up and down, waving to us.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds' eyes swept over
the groups and huddles, then turned back to his team mates, seeing
none of them looking very optimistic. Even Chaz, who had been the
first to step forward, seemed taken aback and a little out of his
depth. There must have been hundreds of people in the main hall alone
and, to make matters worse, a few sets of stairs at one end led up to
another floor above. How many more floors were there? How many
pockets would they have to search?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You know what? How
about we just ask someone if they've
seen her,” Dodds suggested. He broke from his team mates, making
his way over to a man he had singled out at random.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Dodds...” Estelle
started.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Estelle, it's
cool, I've got it,” Dodds
said. “I'm just going to
ask if they've seen her.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Be careful,”
Estelle called after him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds looked back over
his shoulder with what he hoped was a confident smile. The man he
walked towards was sat crossed-legged on the floor, hunched over a
bowl of noodles, two chopsticks clasped in his hand. He glanced up as
Dodds approached him, a look of fear spreading across his features.
He shuffled backward as Dodds drew closer and began shaking his head
before turning his full attention back to his food, not wishing to
make eye contact.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hi, how you doing?”
Dodds began. “I'm looking
for a woman... er... girl? You know... not a man?” He gestured
towards men and women as he spoke, hoping to make it clear which
gender he was after.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“&lt;Don't
talk to me! There's already
been enough trouble today! Just leave me alone!&gt;” the man
spluttered back at him. His hands started to shake and he tried to
continue eating, unable to manipulate the sticks enough to grasp the
food in the bowl.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds looked around at
Estelle who shrugged with puzzlement, not understanding, either. He
tried again, “She's a bit
shorter than me, long black hair...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“&lt;Go away! Leave
me alone!&gt;” the man spluttered again, before casting his bowl in
Dodds' direction. He
struggled to his feet, pushing aside those behind him in a bid to
escape, his bowl of noodles clattering to the ground, spilling its
warm contents across the white marble tiled floor. The <I>Knights</I>
watched as he left, other refugees nearby moving closer to one
another and a bit further back from the five pilots.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“This isn't
going to be easy,” Enrique said. Estelle was in agreement. They
were going to have to apply a little more effort if they hoped to
locate their contact amongst all these people.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We'll
just have to search for someone who is a little more cooperative,”
Estelle said. “Split up and see if you can find someone who is more
willing to talk. We'll try
this central area first and then move on into the other parts of the
port. If any of you get into any sort of trouble, shout and we'll
come get you. The moment you find out <I>anything</I>,
I want to know. Don't do
anything without me, that's
an order. Let's go, people.
The sooner we find the agent, the sooner we can leave and get back to
<I>Griffin</I>.”</P>

<B STYLE="font-size:1.16em;">O</B>n
the bridge of <I>Ifrit</I>,
helmsman Alan Cox stood waiting patiently as an engineer took a look
at his console. It was not behaving as it should: the touch-sensitive
surface seeming to be off by a few inches. Every time he tapped at
the screen, there was a chance that a different control to the one he
wanted might be activated. He had started to become concerned when
some of the more delicate operations he needed to perform while the
carrier continued to search for the missing <I>Griffin</I>
became more difficult to execute. For a time, he had traded places
with the controller across from him, so that he could continue his
duty. But now that the carrier was holding position, pausing in its
search, he had taken the opportunity to have the problem dealt with.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Looks like one of
the calibration relay nodes has given out,” the engineer said from
beneath the console, pulling out a small circuit board.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Do you have a
spare?” Cox asked, toying with a screwdriver the engineer had used
to remove the bottom panel of the console.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Plenty. I can go and
get one and be back up soon. Shouldn't
take more than ten or fifteen minutes. Do you need it urgently?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“So-so,” the
navigator replied. “The captain has ordered us to hold position
here. According to him, <I>Griffin</I>
should be somewhere close by. But so far we haven't
detected anything, not even on the long-range scanners.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The way Hawke had been
acting had set Cox on edge. He had voiced these concerns with some of
the other crew once his captain had departed the bridge, on his way
to his private office to receive a communication that had come in
from CSN HQ. Though they did not talk for long, it became evident
that the rest of the crew shared his feelings.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Upon his return, Hawke
had ordered that they jump to an adjoining star system, in which they
would at last find <I>Griffin</I>.
But within minutes of <I>Ifrit</I>
arriving at its destination, the commodore had once again departed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Following the allied
forces' failed attempt to
retake <I>Dragon,</I>
and the unusual disappearance of <I>Griffin</I>,
Hawke had ordered Meyers to return to Spirit alone. He had then taken
<I>Ifrit</I>
and begun a systematic sweep of the nearest adjacent star systems to
Aster, in case <I>Griffin</I>
had become stranded in one of those. But though they had hunted for
many hours, their search had turned up nothing, the likelihood of
finding <I>Griffin</I>
close by diminishing with each system they came to.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
It was as they scanned
their fifth system that Hawke had received the message from naval
headquarters. It had informed him that <I>Griffin</I>
had been located and, as luck would have it, was drifting in a star
system alongside the one they were currently scanning. Hawke had
ordered that <I>Ifrit</I>
make that their destination. But upon arriving, the crew had been
greeted by nothing except another empty system, the only highlight of
the region being the twisted hues of the nebulas that were so
prominent in that part of the galaxy. Hawke had returned to his
private office to watch the message again, so as to, as he had put
it, “ensure that he had not made a mistake”.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
After his lack of
commitment to the previous battle, the crew were beginning to
question his command. Cox was not about to challenge the man's
authority, however; the thought of a stay in the brig and a
court-martial were not high on his list of priorities.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Are you sure we're
in the right place?” the engineer wanted to know, emerging from
beneath and console and looking out the thick glass windows of
<I>Ifrit</I>'s
main viewport, to the empty space beyond. “You could have punched
the wrong destination into the console? Wouldn't
be surprising the way this thing is so out of whack.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I was using that
one,” said Cox, indicating the console across from his own.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Maybe I should check
that one, too?” the engineer suggested.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
At that moment, Cox
heard the bridge lift doors open and looking around he saw Hawke come
striding down the long aisle, people on either side turning in
anticipation of what <I>Ifrit</I>'s
captain would say about the situation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sir,” Cox
requested his captain's
attention. “We've
performed a full sweep of the system and we've
not been able to detect <I>G</I><I>riffin</I>.
Either it's not here or
we're in the wrong place.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, Lieutenant,
we're exactly where we need
to be,” Hawke answered him, eyes focused on the space ahead of him,
not shifting his head the slightest bit to acknowledge the man who
had spoken.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sir...” Cox tried
to engage Hawke once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>Wait</I>,
Lieutenant,” was all that Hawke said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Cox turned and looked
at the engineer, who gave a slight shrug. It appeared to him that
Hawke was watching for something. Cox heard confused whispers being
exchanged across the length of the bridge, many seeking an
explanation for Hawke's statement. The answer came in the form of a
number of consoles, that all started to wail.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Captain, jump points
forming!” a woman's voice
called out. “We've got
incoming on the port, stern... All sides, sir!” She, as did many
others, looked to Hawke for the course of action to take. But despite
what he had just been told, the man did not so much as even flinch.
Hawke stood still, watching ahead of him as a large jump point
swirled into existence. From out of it slipped the dagger-like form
of <I>D</I><I>ragon</I>,
the enormous Confederation battleship slowing as it drew itself up to
<I>Ifrit</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
During the previous
battle <I>Ifrit</I>
had held back from the action, granting Cox only the merest of
suggestions as to the tremendous size of the battleship. Now, with
the hulking mass of <I>Dragon</I>
bearing down upon them, Cox found himself wishing he could once again
be much further away; the other side of the galaxy preferably.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Captain, radars
indicate a number of Imperial frigates have exited jump points and
are on approach vectors,” the same woman reported.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Hawke said nothing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Captain, I suggest
we put full power to shields, arm weaponry and prepare to withdraw
from the system,” Lucas Short, Hawke's
second in command, said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Stand down!” Hawke
spun around, addressing the crew for the first time since returning
to the bridge. Cox, stood the closest to the man, subconsciously
backed up. Hawke's eyes were alight, almost daring anyone to
challenge him. “We're
completely surrounded! We make any sign of aggression and they will
blow this ship to pieces!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
For a moment, Cox did
not know what they should be more afraid of: the arrival of <I>Dragon</I>
and a host of Imperial warships, or Commodore Hawke. He turned
worried eyes in the direction of the engineer, who had backed off a
lot more, himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sir, <I>D</I><I>ragon</I>
is requesting communications,” the operative of the console
adjacent to Cox's said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Grant it,” Hawke
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
A holographic screen
sprung up at the front of the bridge moments later. The screen showed
a man whom none of the crew failed to recognise, having seen his face
not hours earlier that morning, during the mission briefing.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“This is Fleet
Admiral Zackaria of the Imperial Senate battleship, <I>D</I><I>ragon</I>,”
began the highly-decorated man on the holographic projection. “You
will surrender immediately. Drop your shields and prepare to be
boarded.” Zackaria's face
was impassive throughout his brief speech.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“As you wish,
Admiral,” Hawke said. Zackaria's statement was short, but to the
point, and Hawke made no attempt whatsoever to argue against it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Cox felt his blood
freeze as Hawke turned to look straight at him. There was something
about the look in his eyes; as if all humanity had been stripped
clean. Cox fought an urge to flee and escape the unwanted attention.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Relay the order that
we are to receive boarders. All crew are to stand down. We are to
give Admiral Zackaria full, unchallenged access to the ship.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sir, my console...”
Cox somehow managed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Hawke's eyes lowered,
seeing the panel beneath lying open on the floor. He looked to a man
sat at the console across from Cox's.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Mr Parsons...”
Hawke said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Captain, might I
suggest that we take immediate actions to...” Short interrupted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We are <I>surrounded</I>,
Mr Short,” Hawke flared. He looked again to the man he had
addressed as Parsons. “Relay the order to stand down.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parsons hesitated for a
moment and then did as he was ordered, his voice issuing from
speakers and echoing down the numerous corridors of the ship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Cox began to wonder if
this was some sort of ruse, designed to lure the Imperial admiral
over to the carrier, where he could be dealt with. If it was, it was
a particularly dangerous one, with no apparent room for error.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Lower shields,”
Hawke ordered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Bow quadrant?”
came the reluctant answer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>All</I>
shields,” Hawke said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The image of Zackaria
remained patient and still in the hologram, waiting for the
acknowledgement that the Confederation carrier had complied with his
request.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Shields lowered,”
Cox heard, his heartbeat starting to increase. He fingered the
screwdriver he still held, his grip tightening on it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You're
free to come aboard, Admiral,” Hawke prompted to Zackaria, who
terminated the communication without another word.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Moments later, from out
the frontal viewport, Cox saw transport craft begin to depart <I>Dragon</I>,
swinging themselves around from the launch bays running along the
side of the battleship, and heading towards <I>Ifrit</I>.
At first, it appeared that only three shuttles were making their way
over. It then became apparent that the enemy forces intended to fill
every last inch of the carrier with their ranks; the three becoming
five, then seven, then ten, as the numbers built up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Out of the corners of
the bridge's thick glass
window, Cox spied two Imperial frigates, hovering closed by. He
looked to a display further up the bridge: <I>Ifrit</I>'s
radar told the whole story, indicating that the carrier was
surrounded by a total of six frigates; three on each side. Not that
their presence was required. <I>Dragon</I>
needed no assistance. He swallowed and felt a chill run down his
spine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Hawke turned his back
on the crew, to instead follow the progress of the transports that
were streaming from the former Confederation flagship. As he did so,
Cox glanced down the aisle of the bridge. He noticed that Short had
begun to whisper with two others sitting close to him, peeking at the
commodore who was staring out at the enormous battleship, that rested
so close to them. He assumed they had come to the same conclusion as
he: this was no ruse. Whatever the man was planning, it did not
appear to involve the capture of Zackaria. Whether he intended to
bargain with him, whether it be with the crew or the carrier, matters
could not be allowed to progress any further. He watched as they
conferred for sometime before they all nodded in agreement and
prepared to make their move.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Short rose from his
seat. “Commodore Hawke, it is my belief that you are no longer
functioning with the best interests of <I>Ifrit</I>,
her crew or the Confederation at heart.” He started towards the
front. “It is also my belief that your judgement have been
adversely affected by recent events and that you are no longer
capable of making rational decisions. As second-in-command of <I>Ifrit</I>,
I am exercising my authority to hereby relieve you of your post.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Hawke turned from his
admiration of <I>Dragon</I>,
wearing a tired expression, as though his crew had now become a
bother unto him. The two others that Short had been speaking with
stood up with him, flanking his sides as they strode towards the
carrier's captain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Hawke's
face darkened, his expression became quite grim, and in a cold voice
he said, “Return to your seat, Commander.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Short continued as
though not hearing the words. “Lieutenant Lee, Lieutenant Dawes,
please escort Commodore Hawke from the bridge and confine him to
quarters,” he said to the man and woman who walked by his sides.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Hawke said nothing
more. With lightning reflexes, he reached into his jacket and
produced a laser pistol. He trained the weapon on both Lee and Dawes
and, before either of them could react, shot them both neatly in the
foreheads. Their limp bodies slumped to the floor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Cox jumped back. The
need to escape the bridge was now very urgent. He saw that the rest
of the bridge crew appeared to share his thoughts, many having left
their seats and now standing. Cox was unable to comprehend what had
just happened: the speed at which Hawke had not only produced the
weapon, but then dispatched Lee and Dawes, had left him in a state of
total shock and confusion.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As Lee and Dawes
dropped down beside him, Lieutenant Short's
eyes grew wide with fear and he started to back away from Hawke,
looking behind him to two men stood by the bridge's lift doors. Hawke
then trained the pistol on Short himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Security...” Short
started, before Hawke pulled the trigger and he, too, collapsed in a
heap on the ground, blood from all three of the dead beginning to
seep from the wounds in their heads.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Hawke's
eyes darted over the others occupying the bridge, marking out all the
men and women who, though standing, remained rooted in shock.
Movement at the other end of the aisle grabbed his attention and he
focused the pistol to meet the new threat. “Drop them!” he called
to the two security guards who stood at the far end of the long
bridge, next to the lift, who had just broken into a run towards him.
“Drop them now!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The two men obeyed
without question, throwing their guns aside and raising their hands
in surrender. Even though they were a great deal further away than
Short had been, the two security personnel were clearly not prepared
to test just how fast or accurate Hawke could be.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Everyone, down on
your knees, hands on heads,” Hawke spat to his entire bridge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
No-one moved.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“KNEES! NOW!” Hawke
shouted, waving the laser pistol about. It passed in Cox's direction
and the man found himself dropping to the floor as his legs gave way,
his hands flying to the top of his head. The tone in Hawke's voice
told him that the man was in no mood to be trifled with. In the
floor's dim reflection, Cox saw the engineer lower down next to him.
A few moments later, he gingerly raised his eyes from the floor to
look at Hawke.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Behind him, the
transports continued to stream from <I>D</I><I>ragon</I>,
making their way towards the main launch bay of <I>Ifrit</I>.
Hawke continued to mark the crew as they got down on the floor,
watching each and every one of them for the slightest attempt at
escape or attack. In the face of what had just happened, however,
none of them were about to dare, some preferring to stare down at the
floor than at Hawke's
rage-twisted expression.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
It was not long before
the first wing of transports started to enter <I>Ifrit</I>'s
launch bay, setting themselves down inside. Even as they did so, more
could be seen departing <I>Dragon</I>,
forming a huge caravan reminiscent of those departing Spirit earlier
that day. The image of the transports streaming towards the
Confederation carrier, no doubt carrying with them scores of Imperial
soldiers, deadly weaponry and God only knew whatever else, did
nothing but fill all its witnesses with a sense of dread and terrible
unease.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
What would happen when
they arrived? Why was this happening? What did Hawke plan to do? The
questions raced through Cox's mind. Though, for some reason he felt
fear starting to pass, being edged out by a new feeling: anger. He
looked down the bridge, along the rows of crew that were on their
knees. He noted one young man who he could see was trembling. The man
made a quick snap look at the lift. Cox wished he could tell the man
to stay where he was, but he had already made up his mind. Cox saw
him leap to his feet and start towards the lift, arm outstretched,
reaching for the call button.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He managed but a few
feet before Hawke felled him, the thin red beam of the laser cutting
its way through the back of his head. The young man crashed forward
across the floor, legs giving way beneath him, his arms splayed out
as he went down. Like the others that had fallen to the shots, he
gave no cry as he fell, but those who continued to comply with
Hawke's command flinched at
the sound of his body slamming down. Still they kept their hands on
their heads, facing the floor, looking down at the dim reflections of
their own worried faces staring back at them.</P>

The occupants of
<I>Ifrit</I>'s
flight deck stood by powerless as the first of the transports opened
up, the passengers like none they had ever seen before: they were
clad almost entirely in black, save for a strange white emblem on
their left breast and right arm, and a pair of scowling ruby-red
eyes, affixed into their helmets.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The soldiers spilled
out of the craft, rifles raised to secure the area. They spoke no
words, but gestured to the deck's
occupants that they should, like those on the bridge, place their
hands on their heads and get down on their knees. The various
maintenance workers, pilots and other service personnel did as they
were ordered, terrified by the sight before them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
It did not take long
for the soldiers to secure the area, and before long they were
beginning to permeate through into the other areas of the carrier.</P>

“Sir, the admiral...”
Cox heard a woman's voice
come over the carrier's PA
system.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Escort him up to the
bridge,” Hawke said without waiting for her to finish.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
After a time, the
bridge's lift doors opened
and Cox turned to see who was entering the bridge. Four figures stood
within the elevator car as the doors parted, one of them a member of
<I>Ifrit</I>'s
security team. The woman was being held under the arms by two tall
soldiers, who stepped out of the lift and tossed her body down on the
floor, bringing the bridge's
body count up to five. She had been shot in the back of the head, her
blonde hair wet, sticky and matted with the blood that had poured
from the wound. He guessed she had attempted to get to the man whom
the two soldiers were escorting.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Now on the bridge, the
two soldiers stood to attention either side of the lift doors,
presenting their rifles and making way for the last person to depart.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Zackaria strode down
the long aisle towards Hawke, the commodore returning the laser
pistol to the inside of his jacket. He was clothed in formal Imperial
naval dress, the condition of his uniform verging on perfection:
crease free and decorated to great spender. A long, blood red cloak
rippled gently behind him as he walked, falling about a foot clear of
the floor and fastened about the shoulders by a gold chain that ran
just under his neck. Though surrounded by his enemies, he walked with
calm down the bridge's central aisle, the soles of his dark gleaming
shoes clopping on the floor as he went. They seemed to perfectly
punctuate his entrance, being now the only sound besides the tense
breathing of the crew.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Hawke remained where he
was, waiting for the admiral to approach, whereupon he saluted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Cox was shocked; even
more so when the two men began to speak. The language was strange and
he could not understand a single word, yet Hawke's command of the
dialect appeared perfect. It rolled off his tongue effortlessly, and
sounded nothing like the Imperial dialects he was expecting, even
with the admiral's accent. And there was something else there,
something that did not quite sound like normal human speech.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:center;">
*
* *</P>
<P CLASS="western">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western">
The two men spoke at
length, Hawke detailing much of what he knew and what his plans were:
they would take <I>Ifrit</I>
to Phylent, draw <I>Griffin</I>
into a false sense of security and then destroy it. When the ATAFs
returned from their errand, they would be met by <I>Ifrit</I>
and the remains of <I>Griffin</I>,
the former having arrived too late to save the carrier from its fate.
The <I>Knights</I> would
then return to <I>Ifrit,</I>
giving the admiral everything: the ATAFs, the pilots and the means to
study, reverse-engineer and construct more. They would then be
unstoppable; and finally Zackaria would be able to complete his
Mission.</P>

The discussion over,
Hawke readdressed the bridge crew. “I have negotiated the surrender
of <I>I</I><I>frit</I>.
From here on out, I alone will fall under the
command of Fleet Admiral Zackaria. The Empire no longer has need for
any of you; you are all now redundant.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Heads looked up in
shock, eyes darting from the two men that stood at the front of the
bridge, to the two black-clad soldiers that marked the lift doors.
Cox met many eyes as he looked to those knelt on the floor, and they
all said the same thing: their worst fear was upon them, they were
going die. Even if they could escape the bridge and make it down to
the flight deck, there was no telling just how many soldiers would be
waiting for them down there.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
But for Cox, that was
the last straw. He had to do something about this. He might not be
able to save <I>Ifrit</I>
or guarantee that the crew could get away from the enemy forces that
surrounded them, but he would make certain that Hawke did not
celebrate his victory here today.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Grasping the
screwdriver that he had secreted in his hands when Hawke had ordered
them all down on the ground, he ensured the shaft was fully exposed.
Just like Hawke's neck. He
started to build himself up; preparing to drive the tool into the
man's throat; to rip it
apart so that the man suffocated or drowned in blood or whatever
would happen when he drove the implement home. And after a few
moments of mental preparation, he was ready.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He made no sound as he
moved. No heroic cry or final comment as he went at the commodore. He
moved fluidly, as only one might under such circumstances, in one
final attempt to bring about justice. He did not falter nor stumble,
his leap from his knelt position towards Hawke verging on perfection.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The next few seconds
became a blur of pain and confusion. It started with a solid grasp of
the arm in which he held the small weapon. It was followed by a loud
snapping noise, a spinning of his world, and ending in a tremendous
amount of pain, the screwdriver flying from his hand, its task
unfulfilled. He felt himself crash against both a wall of the bridge
and then the floor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
For a time, his world
was black. The dizziness then cleared and he came to, feeling total
agony. He lifted his head as best he could, trying to will the stars
away that were filling his vision. He couldn't move his legs; they
were unresponsive and useless. Even lifting his head felt like a
monumental task. He fought to piece together what had happened to
him...</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As he had leapt up, the
handle of the tool held tight in his hand, his heroic intents had
been thwarted by Zackaria. Without a word, the admiral had caught his
outstretched arm about the wrist as he drew back in preparation to
plunge the implement into Hawke's
neck. With one quick and powerful twist, he had broken the helmsman's
arm and the screwdriver had tumbled from Cox's grasp. Zackaria had
then spun the man around and <I>thrown
him</I> in the direction he had been heading.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He remembered feeling
the sensation of travelling through the air, but it was something he
struggled with; for he had not travelled just a few feet with the
throw, but the remaining width of the bridge itself. He had flown a
distance of well over ten meters, his feet leaving the floor by
several meters themselves. The height baffled him. He may have
travelled much further, if the wall on the opposite side of the
bridge had not halted his advance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He couldn't believe
what had just happened: <I>t</I><I>he
man was over sixty years </I><I>old!</I>
And yet he had, with precious little effort, disarmed and then thrown
him across the bridge, as if he were nothing more than a small
animal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Cox could not stand,
nor move his legs, no matter how hard he tried. He became aware of a
pair of black shoes in front of him, and turned two pleading eyes up
to face <I>Ifrit</I>'s
captain, imploring him to find mercy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
But the pleas passed
straight through the man.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Thank you for all
your hard work over the years, Mr Cox,” Hawke said, his face
pitiless. “But your services are no longer required.” He once
again drew the laser pistol, pointed it at Cox's head, and pulled the
trigger.</P>

With the carrier under
his command, Zackaria ordered that the crew be killed and their
bodies dumped out into space. There were to be no exceptions:
prisoners would not be taken, lives would not be spared.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
They fought valiantly,
but <I>Ifrit</I>'s
crew were no match for the invaders. The black-clad soldiers
slaughtered each and every one of them, showing no mercy as they
followed their leader's orders through to the letter. For Zackaria's
command was what they adhered to; what they believed in; and what
they would obey until the day they died.</P>

“Something's
happened to her,” Dodds said to Estelle, who walked by his side.
“She would have found us by now, we're
not exactly being inconspicuous.” Despite Parks'
statement that the woman wouldn't be jumping up and down and waving
her arms, they had reached the conclusion that Barber would have made
herself known to them by this time. They continued to walk through
the ranks of refugees, once again trying to spot that which they may
have missed. Most of the refugees had refused to speak to them, and
those that had spoken had been unwilling to help, wanting nothing
more than to be left alone. A few had even made violent responses to
the enquiries, either shouting and throwing things, or leaping up and
taking a swing at the Confederation pilots.</P>

Chaz continued his own
walk amongst the ranks of refugees. Those he passed were still not
used to his presence, and acted as though he was an executioner,
seeking out the next prisoner for the gallows. Many turned their eyes
away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Unlike his fellow
<I>Knights</I>,
he had not spoken to anyone since arriving, having instead taken his
time to pace the huddles, searching for just the right person to make
contact with. Now he believed he had found them and stopped in front
of a little boy, who had been watching him the whole time. Compared
to the others, the boy did not seem in the least perturbed by Chaz's
presence; more curious. Sitting alone, he must have only been about
six or seven years old, maybe younger.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz crouched down in
front of the boy, who still had not taken his eyes off him. Unlike so
many of the others in the port, the boy did not pull back or try to
hide himself, though many of those near him did, shuffling back and
crushing up against one another in Chaz's
presence. No-one came to assist the little boy or take him away.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz had been correct
in his assumption that the boy was all alone, a heavily stuffed bag
containing a few items of clothing sat next to him was his only
apparent possession. What had become of his family and friends Chaz
did not need to guess at. Nevertheless, the boy in front of him
appeared to be quite brave and one of the few people who may offer a
helpful response. Before all that, however, there was one small
hurdle that needed to be overcome. Chaz stole a glance over his
shoulder to see if his team mates were anywhere close by, before he
started talking.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“&lt;Hello there. My
name's Chaz. What's
yours?&gt;” he asked with a warm smile. He spoke in a near-fluent
Imperial dialect, keeping his voice calm and relaxed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“&lt;Ben,&gt;” the
boy said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“&lt;Nice to meet
you, Ben. I'm looking for a
friend of mine. I was hoping you might have seen her.&gt;”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“&lt;What's
her name?&gt;” Ben asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz smiled to himself.
It amused him that the boy was assuming that was all the information
he would need. His mind wandered for a scarce few seconds. <I>I
bet you're just like that</I>, he thought, before
returning to the job in hand. “&lt;Her name's
Clare.&gt;”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“&lt;No, I don't
know her,&gt;” Ben said, with a shake of his head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz decided to supply
some more information. “&lt;She's
a tall woman, with straight black hair, very pretty. She's
about my age. She wasn't
born in the Empire, she comes from...&gt;”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“&lt;The
Confederation lady who was chasing the man?&gt;” Ben interrupted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“&lt;That's
her,&gt;” Chaz said, still smiling.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“&lt;She's
dead.&gt;”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz's
smile slipped. The little boy did not seem to notice or, more likely,
could no longer feel sympathetic towards those suffering from loss,
it being an all too common occurrence for him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“&lt;They put her in
the hospital with the other man she killed when they had a fight
together. They were shooting each other a lot,&gt;” Ben added.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“&lt;Thank you,
Ben.&gt;” Chaz stood up; he had all the information he needed.</P>

Still wandering about,
trying to find someone who might be able to help him, Dodds saw Chaz
striding in his direction. As he approached, Dodds noted a look of
anger on his face and took a step backward. It was the same
expression Chaz had worn when Parks had reassigned the five <I>Knights</I>
to the Temper system. The man's fists were balled, his eyes, though
narrowed, blazing. If the security guards on Xalan Orbital had shown
reluctance in tackling Chaz back then, Dodds knew that right now it
would be like confronting a fifteen-hundred-pound grizzly bear.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What's
happened?” Dodds asked as the big man strode up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Barber's
dead,” Chaz growled, not bothering to stop and causing Dodds to
hurry along after him. “She's
been taken to the infirmary.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We should let the
others know.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, you should,”
was the blunt reply.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds stopped walking
at the comment. For the few months Dodds had known him, he had found
that Chaz was generally a very quiet character. Every now and again
he was moody, but easy to get along with when you got on the right
side of him, even if he did have almost nothing to say. Watching the
man's back retreating past
him, Dodds figured that at this very moment there was no right side
of Chaz to be on.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Under the
circumstances, he decided it would be best to do as Chaz had
suggested and soon rounded up the other <I>Knights,</I>
who then, after consulting a floor plan, made their way towards the
port's medical unit.</P>

“Sound proof,”
Dodds said as the doors to the infirmary swung closed behind the four
men and women, dampening the sounds from the rest of the port.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Probably to help the
staff and the patients relax,” Enrique said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You're
sure he came in here?” Estelle said. She had almost lost her mind
when Dodds had informed her that Chaz had headed off to the infirmary
alone and without consulting her. Not that there had been very much
to discuss.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Like I said, he
seemed rather keen to get here,” Dodds said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“See if you can lock
the door,” Estelle ordered. Dodds did as he was told and after
studying a panel next to the door he succeeded in securing it. The
little clicking sound told him that it was not a very sturdy lock,
more of a deterrent than anything else.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The <I>Knights</I>
moved down various corridors in their search for Chaz and Barber, the
whole place looking like a small hospital. They searched every
waiting and examination room they came to, but found them empty,
without any sign of their missing wingmate or the woman they had
arrived at the station to meet. They then came to the mortuary.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Are you okay?”
Enrique said to Kelly as they approached the mortuary. Dodds, too,
had noticed that she had not spoken to anyone whilst looking for
Barber, and seemed to be in a world of her own.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm
fine, just a bit distracted,” Kelly said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sure?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes. It's
nothing,” she said after a moment's
hesitation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You don't have to
come in if you don't want to,” Dodds said, aware that Kelly was not
good with dead bodies. No matter how many she saw, she could never
get used to them, absurd visions and fears filling her head. The
thought of walking into a morgue, knowing it to contain at least one
body already, couldn't have been sitting too comfortably with her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, we stay
together,” Estelle interjected, before she heaved the heavy door of
the mortuary open, revealing the scene within to all. There, standing
over a gurney with his back to them, was Chaz. A sheet, stained with
blood, lay on the floor at the foot of the table.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle stopped just
inside the doorway, her arms folded across her chest, displeasure
written all over her face. Dodds took in the scene. Estelle was used
to having Dodds and Enrique challenging her authority from time to
time, but they did at least either fall back into line or back down.
Chaz on the other hand had completely ignored her order to inform her
of any developments in the search for Barber and not to take any
action without first consulting her. She would not stand for his
insubordination.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Lieutenant Koonan,
what the hell do you think you're
doing?” Estelle asked, scowling at his back. Chaz did not turn
around or react at all. Estelle glowered; now the man was ignoring
her. “Lieutenant?” she said again. Chaz neither moved from where
he stood, nor made any other sign to acknowledge her presence.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds walked forward
and came to stand next to Chaz, Estelle and Enrique following behind
him. He looked down at the woman lying on the gurney, her eyes still
open, dried blood staining her mouth and chin, her face very pale.
Chaz's eyes were filled with
a mixture of anger and sadness as he continued to stare down at the
woman, his fists still clenched into tight balls by his sides.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds looked around and
saw that Kelly had taken few steps forward, making little effort to
cross the threshold of the mortuary doorway. She gave him a look of
deep concern as her eyes shifted from Barber to Chaz.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
After a few moments,
one of Chaz's hands left his
side. Two fingers found their way to the woman's
eyes and gently closed her eyelids.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Does she have the
data card?” Estelle asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz continued to say
nothing, and instead ran his fingers across Barber's cheek. It was as
if he was saying goodbye.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds saw Estelle mouth
several curses, then, “We don't have time for this.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Seeing the man as being
disinterested in Estelle's
questioning, Dodds once more took the initiative and reached forward
to investigate Barber's
jacket. Chaz caught him tight about the wrist as he took hold of the
zipper.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'll
do it,” he said in a cold voice, without taking his eyes off
Barber's face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds looked up at the
big man, knowing that he would not be able to free his wrist from
such a solid grasp. He released his grip on the zipper. Chaz took it
instead and undid the dead woman's
jacket, exposing the white vest she wore underneath. It was soaked
with blood and torn in places where it had been slashed. Beneath the
ripped material, crimson spots of congealed blood, gathered around
lacerated white flesh, were quite visible. They looked like stab
wounds. Dodds was reminded of Dean's wounds, as the man had lain
dying on his parents' couch.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz started to search
the inner pockets of the jacket as the others looked on. After he
failed to find anything, he checked the outer ones. Then those of her
trousers. His searching started to become more urgent as he turned
out more and more pockets and did not find what he was looking for.
He then pulled off her boots, though from the way they were so
tightly laced it was doubtful he'd find anything there. Whoever had
brought the woman in here had decided to dump her body on the first
available trolley and leave it there. The boots turned out to be
empty and there was nothing in the socks, either.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What's
wrong?” Estelle asked as Chaz let an empty boot fall to the floor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Isn't it obvious? I
can't find the card,” Chaz
said, acknowledging his commanding officer for the first time since
entering the morgue. He began to dump more items on the floor and the
gurney as his search continued.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Knowing that his help
was not wanted, Dodds left the others to continue sorting through
Barber's possessions and
pulled back a sheet that was covering a body on another gurney,
opposite that of Barber's.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Chaz, how did she
die?” Dodds asked, looking down into the scar-riddled face of the
dead man he had uncovered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
There was a pause,
then, “A man killed her,” he said, his voice bitter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“This man?” Dodds
asked, indicating the body. Chaz and the other three <I>Knights</I>
glanced around, seeing the exposed body with its long coat and
clothes even more bloodstained than Barber's
vest.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“She killed him at
the same time. That's all I
know,” Chaz said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The answer was good
enough for Dodds. “This is our man. This is the guy who blew up
<I>Cardinal</I>.”
He began to rifle through the pockets of the man on the table.
Enrique and Estelle hurried over to join him in his quest to locate
the data card, but after a thorough search they failed to locate
anything. Just as Chaz had done, they also checked boots, socks and
other possible hiding places, to no avail.</P>

Kelly caught Chaz's
eye as she stood out of the way, still quite unnerved by the dead
bodies. He gave her a look that emphasised his utter frustration.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Want me to take a
look?” she offered, although she asked only out of politeness and
courtesy, and not because she wanted to be involved. She regretted it
seconds later when Chaz walked back from the body.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Go ahead,” he
gestured at Barber's body.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Kelly approached and
began her own search, rechecking everywhere that Chaz had already,
though much more gingerly and with added caution. Whenever confronted
with a dead body, she couldn't
help but think that at any moment the eyes would fly open and stare
straight at her, or that a sick smile would crawl up the face, the
grin directed at and meant for her, or that a cold, dead hand would
shoot out and grab her wrist...</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She shook the images
from her head and tried not to think about it. Dead people did not
miraculously come back to life. Once dead, they stayed dead.</P>

Dodds, Estelle and
Enrique were on the verge of giving up with their own task, preparing
to accept that Barber was in possession of the card, and not the man
whom they searched.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Do you think someone
else might have taken it from her?” Dodds said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Well, they didn't
take anything else,” Estelle said, nodding toward the numerous
belongings Chaz had removed from the woman. “If they couldn't
be bothered to take her gun, then why would they bother with
something like that?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Maybe she's
hidden it in some secret compartment? How carefully did you check her
boots? There might be a false bottom or heel?” Dodds looked over at
Chaz.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“There are no hidden
compartments in her boots,” Chaz answered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Gloves? She's a spy,
after all, so there's bound
to be at least one secret hiding place...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“There aren't any,”
Chaz said through gritted teeth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Maybe it's in the
lining of her jacket? Or around the collar? Could even be tucked into
her bra...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Can it, Dodds,”
Estelle said, patting at the raider's
long coat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You sure she's
not just holding it in her hand?” Enrique asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds gave him a look
of disdain.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, seriously,”
Enrique said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“She <I>is</I>
holding something,” Kelly said. She was staring at Barber's right
hand that, unlike the left, was closed up. Dodds and Estelle left the
raider's body and came to
stand by Barber once more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds took the woman's
hand and inspected it. “Looks like plastic.” He tried to prise
her hand open, but found it so stiff as to be unable to even move one
finger. After a while, he was able to push his own little finger
between the gap in Barber's
grip and poked the object out. It fell and bounced gently on the
floor. He retrieved it and held it up for the others to see.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What is it?”
Estelle asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Some kind of tiny
bottle,” Dodds said, turning the clear container between his
fingers. It felt slimy in his grasp and he noticed that a small
amount of fluid still clung to the inside. Estelle took it from him,
almost dropping it as it slipped between her fingers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It's...
it's lubricant,” she said, sounding more than a little confused.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Ah ha! I've got it!”
Enrique said, the four others turning around to the man. “My
grandfather once told me that spies sometimes don't
keep really important stuff directly on them; not in their clothes
anyway, it's too risky. So,
instead, they'll do what
drug mules used to do and...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He stopped talking.
Dodds noted the horrified looks on Kelly and Estelle's faces, a
mirror for his own. The anger had left Chaz's eyes, his face had
fallen. Dodds' eyes went back to Barber as Enrique solved the mystery
of the card's location.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“So basically she's
swallowed it. It's inside
her.” The enthusiastic tone was gone.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
At the words, Kelly's
eyes grew wide and she yanked her hands from where they had been
worming their way into pockets and feeling the lining of Barber's
jacket. She hurried backwards, putting distance between herself and
the gurney.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds found he was
unable to tear his eyes away from Barber's stomach. “I really,
really wish I hadn't gotten out of bed this morning,” he said.</P>

Natalia Grace had, over
the course of the last three weeks, suffered from fitful dreams,
fraught with terrible memories of what she had borne witness to.
Images of packed Imperial troop transports sweeping over crumbling
and almost defenceless cities haunted her vision. She found herself
trapped on their streets, all alone.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The transports landed
and started to deploy their cargo: dozens of heavily armed black-clad
soldiers, carrying all manner of weaponry. The Enemy. They turned to
look at her. Fingers pointed. Natalia ran.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She ran as fast as she
could, but the ground she covered was minimal, as if her legs were
moving in slow motion. She looked behind herself as she tried to
escape, seeing the city now gone and the black suits of the Enemy
swarming behind her like so many thousand scurrying black ants,
spread out across a wide open plain that went on forever to the
horizon, with nowhere to hide.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Amongst the sea of
black shone innumerable pairs of ruby-red oval eyes, set into the
grooves of helmets, the only window into what resided within. She
tried harder to run, but her legs moved as if she were pulling them
through treacle. She fell down, trying with all her might to crawl
herself forward, but finding herself as immobile as ever.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The ranks of black
suits began to close in round her, their faces hidden behind their
ominous masks. She looked around for another way to escape, turning
to the sky, then the ground beneath, but seeing nothing save for the
swells of black, glints of knives, and glow of digital weapon
counters.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Hands caught her upper
arms, then her fore arms, then her legs, pinning her to the ground.
The suffocating black enclosed her, muzzles of rifles pushed into her
face, mixed with flashes of white from emblems borne on the suit. Her
attackers spoke not one word as they prepared to deal her fate.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Natalia shivered in her
stasis capsule, so intense were her dreams. But they did not plague
her forever and soon the darkness departed, allowing the woman to
return to a peaceful, undisturbed sleep; the nightmare having lifted
like a veil, as if moving on to trouble another.</P>

Within a small corridor
of Arlos starport, interconnecting an airlock, a dozing man awoke as
he heard the door's control
panel emit a short bleep. He looked up to see the red light that had
once indicated that the door was locked, had now changed to green. He
blinked himself further awake just as the door slid open, and his
heart almost stopped as he saw his worst nightmare step on through.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Clad in black suits,
helmets covering their heads and faces, the six new arrivals to the
port paused for but a moment to assess their surroundings. Bright
ruby-red eyes fell on the man sitting on the floor, only feet from
where they now stood. They drew their weapons.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The man started to
struggle to his feet, his eyes wide as saucers. A scream lodged
itself in his throat, as if it itself was unwilling to expose itself
to the invaders. A shotgun levelled itself at him. There was a sound
of thunder and tremendous pain ripped through his chest. He toppled
backward and gasped as the pain mixed with shock and disbelief. He
turned a pleading expression to the ruby-red eyes, begging them to
spare his life. He tried to speak, but the scream was still blocking
his throat. A thin gasp was all that was permitted to pass.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He had been safe here!
They had all been safe here! Just a few more hours and he could have
gotten away! He should have made a bigger effort to get on that last
ship out! It wasn't fair!
Why him? Just a few more hours...</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
A second round finished
him, and as his vision faded he saw the invaders start forward,
preparing to deal the same fate, via a multitude of different
weapons, to the other refugees sharing the corridor. They would cut
down everyone that stood before them, taking no prisoners and sparing
no lives.</P>

“We're
going to have to cut her open,” Estelle said, unable to wrench her
eyes away from Barber's
face. The thought was already starting to turn her stomach. She
turned to Kelly who was still backing off, a hand on her own stomach,
as if attempting to quell the churning within. Their eyes met.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'll
keep watch,” Kelly said and darted out of the mortuary without
waiting for any acknowledgement from her commanding officer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'll
go with her,” Enrique volunteered, before he too bolted out the
room after Kelly, leaving Estelle, Dodds and Chaz standing over the
body.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Right... right,”
Estelle said, snapping out of her trance. Though she had tried to
deny it, Enrique was right. All the evidence was there right in front
of her. The thing they had come for was inside the dead woman lying
on the gurney and there was only one way they were going to get it
out. She turned away and began looking around the mortuary. She found
what she was searching for at one end of the room. Her fingers
brushed over a number of different stainless steel medical
implements, before they closed around the one she needed. Grasping it
firmly in her hand, she returned to the two men.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No!” Dodds said in
response to the question that did not need asking.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle thrust the
scalpel towards him, ignoring his protest. “Dodds...” Estelle
said, her voice a little shaky.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No! No way!” he
said again, retreating to the other side of the gurney, putting the
dead woman between the two of them. He pointed to the scalpel. “And
certainly not with <I>that</I>,
that archaic tool! Isn't there a laser cutter?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, we have to use
this.” She heard it come almost like an apology.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Why? Cutters are
good enough for organs...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It could damage the
card. Now, come on, Dodds.” She made to walk around the gurney.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, Estelle, stay
there! No, Estelle, stay! You'll
have to do it. I can't.”
His voice was shaking, his face showing unmistakable signs of
distress.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm
not doing it,” Estelle said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Why not?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Because I'm
your superior and... and I'm
ordering you to.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds'
distressed expression disappeared for a fraction of a second, to be
replaced by one of disbelief. “You're
<I>ordering</I> me to?”
he said, incredulously.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, Dodds, I'm
ordering you to.” Her voice was shaking again, as was the scalpel
she held. She could see part of her own face reflected in it. It did
not look confident.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds gave a tiny,
humourless chuckle. “Well, then I guess I'm
going to have to disobey that order, Lieutenant.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Dodds!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What are you going
to do about it, Estelle?” Dodds said, throwing his hands up into
the air. “File a report that said I refused to cut open a dead
woman upon your orders because I was too scared? In that case, you'd
better prepare to add yourself, as well as Kelly and Enrique, to that
list.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle said nothing,
not blaming Dodds for refusing to do as she said. She had merely
chosen to flex her muscles as the commanding officer and delegate an
undesirable duty on to another. The idea of cutting open the woman
lying on the table was no more appealing to her than any of them. But
if she could pass on the responsibility... She looked to the last
person in the room, that had not yet expressed an objection to the
task.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Chaz?” The big man
looked around at her, his focus having still been on Barber, his
expression remorseful. “You were keen to get here and get this
done.”</P>

The scalpel hovered in
front of him, still held in Estelle's
hand, the light catching it in places as the woman's
hand shook. Chaz looked once again to Barber and then back again to
the scalpel, before he plucked it from Estelle's
grasp.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Yes, he had been keen
to get here, but not to do this. He had not believed what the little
boy, Ben, had told him. He had to see the truth for himself. Even
now, with the evidence lying in front of him, it was difficult for
him to believe. He looked again at Barber's
peaceful face and thought back over the memories.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>You
were just doing your job</I>, he thought to himself, before he

Dodds and Estelle gave
one another a worried look as the big man held the scalpel,
acknowledging neither of them. He stood with his eyes focused on
Barber's face, as if stuck
in his own world.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Chaz?” Dodds
prompted him after a time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Just give me a
second, okay?” Chaz said in a quiet voice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">

Sweeping into the
central hall, the six black-clad soldiers were given the same
reception as they had in the airlock corridor. Even though the
refugees here had had some forewarning of what was to come, hearing
the gunfire and cries of the earlier victims, most were still quite
unprepared. The screams and shouting began at the first sighting of
the black suits and, as one, people rose and tried to escape. Even
before the soldiers began their slaughter there were casualties:
limbs were tangled, bones were snapped, and heads were crushed in the
stampede.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Their weapons already
drawn, the lead soldiers fired upon those immediately in front of
them, bursts of plasma bolts burning through clothes and ripping into
flesh, repeated hits opening up gaping wounds and spilling blood.
Bullets performed to a lesser degree, but were no less accurate as
they were deadly. In the space of just a few seconds, the area around
the soldiers was splattered with blood, torn clothing and burnt lumps
of flesh that had been torn from their victims.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Behind the front row,
two other soldiers each pulled a grenade and threw them deep into the
crowd. The explosions had their desired effect of killing many,
maiming others and causing even greater panic.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With their dramatic
entrance over, the soldiers advanced after their prey. No-one was to
be spared: infants, children, men, women and the elderly were all
fair game. There was no return fire from any of the refugees, not
even the slightest attempt to defend themselves; the men and women
well aware of the futility of such actions.</P>

<I>Okay, you've had a
good run. Ten years of service, a couple of major operations; one
colossal one. You've nearly been killed, let's see, three or four
times. Today may as well count for another ten. Plenty to talk about
and inspire others with. Could probably spin out two or three books
from it. I think I deserve to take the rest of my life off now. At
least I don't have to witness the amateur surgery. Thank God for
small mercies...</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Kelly sat on the floor,
hugging her knees and reminiscing over the past.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You okay, Mouse?”
Enrique said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Please don't
call me that.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“They'll be done
soon. Just try not to think about it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Then stop bringing
it up.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
In their bid to get
away from the goings-on in the morgue, the two had retreated back to
the main entrance to the medical unit, Enrique having taken point at
the door.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sorry,” Enrique
said, then, “What's
wrong?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Kelly saw him looking
at her with concern. She had been rubbing at the side of her head.
“My head still hurts,” she said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Enrique left his post
at the door and knelt down beside his friend. “Want me to look?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah, see if you can
see anything. Here,” Kelly indicated to the side of her head, that
she had knocked in the cockpit. Enrique parted her brown hair in the
area she had shown him, looking for signs of trauma. She was not
entirely sure what he should be looking for, as she had not found
anything herself; no cuts and no bleeding, although there might be a
bruise. He persevered until she winced and turned her head around to
escape his exploring fingers, taking hold of one of his hands with
hers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sorry,” he said
once more, as she looked around to face him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Anything?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Nothing on the
surface. You might have bruised your brain.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Kelly smiled and let
out a chuckle. It sounded funny. Enrique smiled, too.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
For a moment, they both
became aware of how close they were to one another, their hands
holding on to one another's.
They stayed motionless for a few moments, looking into one another's
eyes, neither speaking.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Enrique, I think you
should be keeping your eyes on the <I>door</I>,”
she said after a while, breaking their gaze and turning away to look
down the corridor in the direction of the morgue. Enrique released
her hand and returned to his post.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I don't
know about you, but I just want to get out of here,” Kelly said.
“This day has been too long. Do you think they'll
be done soon?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Enrique didn't answer
her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She looked up, to see
him staring fixated out the door's small oval window. “Enrique?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“People are moving,”
Enrique said. He then swore loudly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We've
got company!” The man had frozen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What's
going on?” Kelly asked, starting to get to her feet, so she could
see for herself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Don't
move,” Enrique hissed, waving her back down. He remained where he
was for a few more moments before he pulled back from the door and
grabbed Kelly's hand,
hauling her up off the floor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Enrique, what's
happening?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Soldiers!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What?” Kelly said
as he dragged her down the corridors and back towards the morgue. She
tried to stop him pulling her in its direction, but he was holding
her hand tight. “I'm not
going back in there!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Given the choice, I
don't think you'd prefer to be out there, either!” Enrique answered
as they continued running. Moments later, they reached their
destination.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Imperial soldiers!”
Enrique shouted, as he and Kelly sprinted in through the mortuary
doorway.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Kelly saw her other
three companions, still standing around Barber's body, jerk around.
Chaz was holding something small and silver. It appeared to be a
scalpel.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What?” Dodds said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Enrique gave Kelly a
look that said he was tired of that question. “Imperial soldiers
have just entered the port!” he panted. “They're
armed and firing on the refugees! One is coming this way!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Imperial soldiers?”
Chaz said. “You're sure?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Positive,” Enrique
said. “Saw them through the window. He looked straight at me. I'm
not sure if he saw me, but they were...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What are they
wearing?” Chaz demanded, not waiting for Enrique to finish.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Huh?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Enrique, <I>what
are they wearing</I>?” the big man raised his voice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Recovering her breath,
Kelly saw something that made her feel the most unsettled she had all
day: it was the look on Chaz's
face. It was a panicked expression. The man was worried. Very
worried.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Black uniforms,”
Enrique said. “Completely black, with these bright red visors or
eyes, and...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hide!” Chaz said,
putting the scalpel down on Barber's
belly, gathering up the sheet and hurling it back over her body.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“But, there are five
of us...” Estelle started, sounding confident that all of them
would be able to handle the new threat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Believe me,
Lieutenant, we should hide,” Chaz said, in a grim voice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds glanced around
the mortuary, before turning back to Chaz incredulously. “Where?!”</P>

open the last examination room door before he came to the mortuary,
the black-clad soldier scanned the interior from the entrance,
keeping his shotgun raised. After confirming there was no immediate
opposition, he stalked into the room to carry out a closer
inspection. He checked under the examination table, up against the
wall; within the wall-high storage cabinet; and then above him,
looking for air vents and other out-of-the-way hiding places. Just
like the other rooms, this one was empty, no-one seeming to have fled
in here.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He backed out of the
room, spinning around as he stepped back through the entrance,
anticipating an attack from the corridor. None came. He then started
towards the mortuary. He was confident that somewhere in the medical
unit he would find his prey. The doors to the medical unit itself had
been locked from the inside, though a single shot to the external
control panel from his pistol had been enough to grant him access.</P>

The sight that greeted
the soldier as he opened the door to the morgue was nothing out of
the ordinary. Six bodies, covered in sheets, lay on gurnies lining
the walls. Two were bloodstained.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Keeping his shotgun
raised, he inched through the door, halting as more details of the
inside of the mortuary came into view. Several roused his suspicions:
the first was the presence of five objects that resembled propulsion
packs, bundled into a corner next to a locker; the second, a small
pile of random items, including two pairs of boots and socks, stuffed
under one of the bloodstained gurnies; and the third, a round
reflective object, resting under another. It looked like a flight
helmet. Still, he saw no-one.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He turned his attention
to the bodies on the gurnies, moving to the one with the many items
deposited beneath it; the one closest to the door. He reached down
and snatched aside the linen cover, momentarily distracted by a
tinkling sound as he did so. Discovering the source of the noise to
be nothing more than a small surgical instrument, he trained his
weapon back on the body on the trolley. The woman's
eyes were closed, her skin pale. Her face seemed to lack warmth. He
studied her for a moment, searching for signs of life, before then
nudging the face with the barrel of his gun. There was no reaction;
the woman was indeed dead. Even so, he would check the others. He
circled around the woman's
gurney, coming to stand by the next in the row. Shotgun still poised,
he extended a hand to remove the pure white sheet...</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
A bumping from a locker
at the far end caused him to swing around and he returned his
outstretched hand to beneath the shotgun, steadying it in preparation
to tackle the threat. The sound appeared to have come from the same
locker the propulsion packs had been dumped next to. The locker,
however, now stood still and silent. He nonetheless watched it
closely. Moments later, there was another sudden bumping sound,
followed by a soft groaning.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He paced forward,
keeping his weapon trained on the locker the whole time, ready to
counter any attack that might come from within. He took up a ready
position in front of the door and flung it open, his hand flying back
to steady his shotgun as he saw the figure hiding within lunge
forward to attack him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He discharged the
shotgun at point-blank range, sending the man back into the locker
from whence he came. The man crumpled down like a puppet that had
just had its strings cut, stiff limbs dropping. The soldier kept his
eyes on the man, preparing to fire once more if there was another
attempt to attack him, or if the first shot had not done its job of
downing his opponent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
But the man made no
further movements, and the soldier bent down over the body to examine
it. Like that of the woman he had seen lying on the gurney, the man's
skin was pale and there were no signs of respiration, the blank eyes
already staring ahead. He realised that his attacker had been dead
all along, and that he had just shot a corpse. With the deception
uncovered, he rose and turned back just in time to face a new
attacker.</P>

Dodds lunged for the
shotgun the black-suited invader still held tight in one hand,
attempting to disarm him, just as the soldier made to fire the weapon
once more. With the element of surprise on his side, Dodds succeeded
in directing the shotgun into the air, where it discharged harmlessly
into the ceiling. This it did several more times as the pair tussled,
before the soldier responded to Dodds'
attempt to separate him from his weapon by releasing his grip on the
shotgun and catching the young pilot with a powerful swing of his
fist across the face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds fell to the
ground, disorientated by the blow, his vision filling with stars. As
he tried to make sense of his world, he heard a short, sharp click,
followed by the clatter of several spent shell cases bouncing on the
floor close to him. The soldier had begun reloading his weapon, the
rapid clicking of fresh shells slotting into place making clear
warnings of what was to come.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds was just starting
to his feet when he heard the soldier load the seventh and final
shell, snap the gun shut, and then cock it. Time seemed to slow. He
looked up into the bright red eyes of the eerie black helmet as the
shotgun was swung in his direction. A moment later, he found himself
staring down the barrel.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He heard a bang,
followed by a grunt. The shotgun fell away and the soldier stumbled
backward. Three further explosions followed, accompanied by a number
of cries of pain from behind the black helmet, before the solider
fell backward and crashed down onto the floor. Dodds saw blood
glistening on the black suit as it began to pour from wounds and onto
the floor, creating a small pool. Despite appearances otherwise, the
soldier was clearly not wearing any form of body armour, and the suit
had provided him with little protection.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds looked around to
see Estelle, panting and steadying a pistol in both hands. He
recognised it as the gun that had belonged to Barber and remembered
Chaz removing it from its holster inside the woman's
jacket, during his search for the data card. Estelle must have picked
it up during the scramble to hide. She looked down at him as the
others emerged from their hurried and uninspiring hiding places. Her
eyes held a mixture of feelings; his, only an apology.</P>

As Enrique had relayed
the warning of the soldier's
impending arrival to the mortuary, the <I>Knights</I>
had wrenched off their propulsion packs and hidden beneath the sheets
of the spare gurnies, feigning their own deaths. Their packs had been
thrown into a corner, next to a locker, and each of their flight
helmets dropped under their respective gurnies. There had only been
four empty trolleys, and Chaz had pulled the raider's
body off his table and pushed him into the locker. Though there had
been no time to hide any evidence of their recent activities, Dodds,
Estelle, Kelly and Enrique had hoped that the soldier would take one
look around and then leave; though, from his behaviour, Chaz seemed
to have expected otherwise. Their saving grace had come in the form
of the raider Chaz had put in the locker. His hurried bundling of the
man's body into the storage
cabinet had resulted in it crumpling down, knocking against the
insides as it did so. The soldier had gone on to mistake the corpse's
sliding for someone trying to hide themselves away.</P>

“We've
got to get out of here,” Chaz said, throwing off his sheet. He
glanced in the direction of the fallen soldier lying still on the
floor, on top of the body of the raider. He hesitated, for a time
caught up an internal debate as to which task he should be attending
to first. He then headed back over to the gurney on which Barber's
body rested, snatching up the scalpel from where it lay on the floor
as he went.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The jacket already
undone, he used the scalpel to cut apart Barber's
bloodstained vest, but stopped short of cutting into her flesh. He
once again stared down at Barber's
smooth white skin, finding it too hard to carry through the task laid
before him. He felt how cold she was as his fingers brushed her
stomach.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Chaz,” Estelle
started again, fiddling with the pistol she still held. “If you
can't do it...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I can. Just give me
a second,” he answered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“... I can do it
instead,” Estelle finished.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I
SAID GIVE ME A DAMN SECOND!” Chaz shouted back in
frustration at his pending task. He stood breathing for a while,
concentrating hard and searching for the will to begin. After just a
few seconds of mental preparation, he found it and immediately
plunged the scalpel into Barber's
belly. He began cutting downwards, working fast and making jagged
sawing actions with the blade as he went. The world around him seemed
to disappear. He heard nothing and saw nothing but the knife; almost
slipping into a trance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm
sorry,” he said under his breath. “I'm so sorry.”</P>

“Hey, you okay?”
Enrique asked as Dodds struggled to his feet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah,” Dodds said,
even though he was not so sure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Your face is really
bruised,” Kelly said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds touched the side
of his face, feeling it hot and a little swollen. The power of the
blow had been tremendous and he found himself amazed that the force
had bowled him over. He was counting himself lucky that he had not
been knocked out. He recalled during his struggle with the soldier
over the shotgun that his feet had almost been lifted off the floor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He looked over to where
Estelle and Chaz were standing over the gurney. Chaz's hands were
already covered in blood and, though she was overseeing the task, he
could tell that Estelle was fighting the urge to turn away. Chaz's
eyes appeared to be glazed over as he drove the knife deeper.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds found himself
compelled to investigate his opponent and wandered over to the
soldier's unmoving body. The
man still held the shotgun in one hand and Dodds kicked it away
before he squatted down. He noted that the soldier's suit, which he
had originally mistaken to have been a construct of ceramics, was in
fact composed of little else but leather. It was thicker in some
areas than others, extra smooth, hardened padding on the shoulders,
elbows, kneecaps and other parts of the body, giving the impression
of armour plating. The texture varied in places, most often around
where one part of the plates joined to another, as well as around
joints.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What are you doing?”
Kelly asked in a suspicious voice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I want to see what
this bastard looks like,” Dodds said, eager to see what lay beneath
that ominous-looking black helmet. It was round in shape and all
encompassing, betraying none of the wearer's
appearance to the world outside. Two tubes and a thin black cable ran
off the back, feeding into the main suit. It looked as though the
tubes existed to aid with respiration, although since Dodds had never
seen anything like it before, they could have existed for any
purpose. He found they were all easily unclipped and, after doing so,
slipped the helmet off the soldier's
head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Wow,” Kelly said,
drawing closer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds could not say
what he had been expecting to find beneath the mask, but he had not
anticipated this: the peaceful-looking face of the man that he looked
upon was - in a word - beautiful. The man's
skin was flawless, with no moles, scars or even any signs of stubble
present anywhere; not even the tiniest of cuts or imperfections. The
skin was so smooth and healthy-looking that the man could well have
been wearing make-up. The man was dark-skinned, the hair on the top
of his head short and almost unbelievably uniform in length. He
looked more like a model than a soldier.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What's
that?” Enrique asked, drawing Dodds and Kelly away from the man's
face. On the left breast of the soldier's
suit was a white emblem unlike anything they had seen before:
contained within a circle was an outline of a man holding a spear in
front of him. Both of the man's
hands gripped the shaft of the weapon, his left higher up the shaft
than the right. The spear was set at a shallow angle, the tip
pointing to the top left of the circle. A sash, tied at the top of
the shaft just below the point, curled its way around the man's
body. The man himself was bald and appeared to be naked, apart from
where the sash preserved his modesty; though the man was depicted
more or less from the waist up, so it was difficult to tell.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds stared at the
emblem for a moment and then ran his fingers over it, feeling the
raised outlines of the image.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That's
not an Imperial insignia I recognise,” Enrique said, his own
fingers working over the emblem.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, I've never seen
that one before, either,” Kelly added.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Neither had Dodds. Like
most, he was more accustomed to the noisy Imperial Coat of Arms,
being a clutter of swords, laurels, felines and just about anything
else the designer had been able to cram into the space the design
afforded. This symbol by contrast was a lot simpler than that, though
not as simple as the designs of the CSN, UNF, or indeed the INF
themselves, those being composed of nothing more than the disjunction
of a few basic shapes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“There's
another one on his right arm,” Dodds said, comparing it to the
first and discovering them to be identical. He looked over at the
helmet he had removed from the man, but discovered that it was devoid
of any such markings. He peeked inside, unsurprised to discover its
main purpose being to serve as protection for the wearer's
head. He noted the eye sockets within, the insides being clear unlike
the red exterior. Two circular grilles on each side at ear level
appeared to aid hearing. What looked like a small inset, unmarked
button resided on the left temple. He put the helmet back down, more
intrigued with the strange white pictorial image on the suit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As he and Enrique
continued to try and make sense of the emblem, Kelly reached down to
the man's right leg and
removed the weapon holstered there.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What you got there?”
Enrique asked the small woman.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Think it's a plasma
pistol,” she said, wandering back towards Estelle and Chaz, turning
it around in her hand as she examined it. “Looks like a high-power
version.” There was a low, high-pitched whine as she switched it
on, a small digital counter on the side lighting up to display the
number of shots remaining in the energy capsule. “Got a full clip,
too.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>Careful</I>!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
It was Chaz. Dodds
looked over to see that the sound had broken his concentration and
that he had stopped cutting, turning his attention from Barber's
stomach to where Kelly stood holding the gun. The big man's hands
were even more blood sodden now, covered up to the wrists. He was
looking at Kelly with an irritated expression on his face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What are you two
doing?” he asked of Dodds and Enrique, who were still knelt over
the unmoving body of the invader.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Just taking a look,”
Dodds said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Then make sure he's
actually dead!” Chaz said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Huh?” Enrique
said. He met Dodds' eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
That was an odd thing
to say. Dodds glanced about to see all eyes were on Chaz, the three
other <I>Knights</I>,
like himself, a little bewildered by his strange comment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What did you say?”
Kelly said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Just as Dodds was about
to press Chaz further with a question of his own, a strange noise
beside him drew him back to the body. Something clattered, bounced
and then rolled along the floor. It was followed by another very
similar sound and this time the “something” rolled into his
fingers. Looking down, he saw a bullet. Dodds picked it up, and
discovered it to be wet and sticky as he rolled it around between his
fingers. The bullet, just like his fingers now were, was covered in
blood. His eyes followed the faint splotches of blood on the floor
from where he had retrieved it, tracing them back to the soldier's
body.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What the hell...”
Dodds said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Oh my God! Dodds!”
Enrique cried.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds looked back in
time to see the eyes of the soldier fly open. The very next moment,
and with incredible speed, a hand shot up and grabbed him tight
around the throat. Dodds choked as the soldier easily got to his
feet, still maintaining a tight hold on him, even as Dodds tugged
against the hand holding him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The soldier's
other hand fumbled about his right leg, closing several times around
nothing as he tried to locate his missing gun. Realising it had been
taken from him, he looked about until he spotted it in the hands of
Kelly. He also caught sight of his shotgun, hidden beneath a gurney
where Dodds had kicked it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With minimal effort, he
threw Dodds from him, attempting to knock down the small woman that
was staring open-mouthed at the unfolding scene. The woman reacted
much faster to the incoming body than she had to the incoming
Imperial fighter earlier that day, and Dodds crashed to the floor,
skidding along past where Estelle and Chaz stood over Barber's
gurney, still trying to discover the whereabouts of the data card.</P>

Enrique saw Dodds land,
roll and then remain still, before he turned back to face the man who
had just got back on his feet. He raised his guard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With one of his
opponents out of the way, the soldier turned his attention to
Enrique, the blonde-haired man now the only thing that stood between
him and his armaments. Weaponless, but not altogether outnumbered,
the soldier fell back on his fists.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Enrique avoided the
first blow, as well as the follow-up, before returning three of his
own into his opponent's
face. He held back none of his power as he struck the man, the blows
he dealt enough to floor many of those he had sparred against in the
past few years, almost certainly knocking them out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The combination over,
he hopped back, only to see that his opponent was still standing, the
strikes not having had the effect that he desired. No blood, no
sweat, not so much as even a grunt. Nothing. The soldier had not so
much as even reeled from the blows. Enrique suddenly felt as though
he were a featherweight boxer, pitched against a super-heavyweight.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
It was then that he
noticed just how big and tall the soldier actually was. It seemed
that even Dodds, who had tackled him earlier, had not found the time
to appreciate the height of the man. He was just as big as Chaz and
also as stocky, but with something else added. Enrique had sparred
with Chaz many times and, on more than one occasion, the big man had
called time outs when Enrique took it too far. Enrique knew there
would be no such call here, however; not because the pair were
fighting for their lives, but simply because the soldier did not need
one.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The soldier once again
swung at him, as if nothing had happened. He managed to parry the
attack, but failed to land his own counterattack. The two then
engaged in a more serious fight, fists flying, legs attempting to
connect kicks, grapples made and broken. Enrique's
face betrayed his situation, stunned at the fact that the soldier was
still standing. He knew he was not going to be able to hold off the
soldier for very long.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Estelle, shoot him!”
he called, ducking under a swing and looking to his wing commander
for assistance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I can't, it's
empty!” Estelle shouted back. She looked back at the clutter of
items next to the gurney, unable to recall seeing any more magazines;
although they might be in there, somewhere. She did the only thing
she could think of, and with all her might, she threw the pistol at
the soldier's head. It missed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Thanks!” Enrique
said as the gun bounced off the wall and clattered to the floor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The soldier caught
Enrique's leg as he attempted to deliver a kick to him, tipping
Enrique backward. He crashed into the gurney behind him, overturning
the metal trolley and causing it to smash onto its side.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle ran, seeing the
shotgun exposed and anticipating the soldier's next move. Reaching it
first, she kicked it further back up the room before then attempting
to take the man on, herself, hoping to give Enrique a chance to get
back to his feet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">

Their plight had not
gone unnoticed by Chaz, who was working faster than ever now that the
urgency of the situation had reached new heights. Just as he thought
he wasn't going to find anything, his fingers closed around something
small, solid and cylindrical. Drawing it out and wiping away blood,
he discovered it to be some sort of tiny plastic capsule. Inside was
something thin and blue. That was good enough for him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Stepping back from
Barber's body, he saw that
the soldier was starting to overcome Enrique, the black-clad invader
landing two successive punches across the man's face. Enrique cried
out with the blows and stumbled backward. Estelle was lying on the
floor behind him, the wind knocked out of her from a boot to the
stomach, her reward for coming to Enrique's aid.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What are you
standing there for?” he shouted at Kelly, who had remained rooted
to the spot following the soldier's
miraculous resurrection. She did not seem to even hear Chaz or be
aware of anything, until he wrenched the plasma pistol from her hands
and shoved her aside, lining himself up with the soldier.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Enrique, get down!”
he barked at the man up front. Enrique did not need to be told twice
and fell backward, away from his enemy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz proceeded to fire
the pistol three times: the first bolt struck the soldier square in
the face; the second tore straight through his right temple; the
third shot struck the soldier in the forehead, almost taking the top
of his skull off. The man's
lifeless body tottered for a fraction of a second before it slumped
down onto the floor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz strode forward,
ignoring everyone else and knelt over the body, keeping the pistol
trained on it the whole time. After some inspection, he was satisfied
that the soldier was now dead. He then started looting the man's
suit, pulling out all of the various items that were contained within
and about it.</P>

Dodds pulled himself to
his feet once more, his back sore from the landing. Enrique flipped
over and started to stand, moving to help Estelle who was still
trying to draw breath. He caught Dodds' eye as he did so, glancing at
Chaz and then back again, wanting to know, as Dodds, the same thing:
<I>Where
the hell did he learn to fire a gun like that?</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
His
short-known team mate had handled the firearm as
if it was second nature to him; as though he had used it every single
day for years and years. Whilst Estelle had held Barber's pistol as
though it burned her hand, Chaz had wielded the gun with total
confidence. And the accuracy of the shots he had gone on to fire, had
more than asserted his marksmanship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds rubbed the back
of his head and looked on at the carnage in front of him. What he had
just seen was impossible: Estelle had shot the invader four times,
landing all the bullets in the torso. Yet a few minutes later, the
man was back on his feet as if nothing had happened. He spotted one
of the bullets that he believed had been embedded in the man, now
resting on the floor close to the body.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Had the bullet missed?
No, it couldn't have. There
had been blood, the man had fallen. He had heard the cries of pain
behind the mask. The bullet he had picked up had also been sticky
with blood and the man's
suit had been torn where the projectile had entered. Surely he
couldn't have imagined all
of that. <I>And the strength!</I>
If it weren't for the pain in his lower back - he considered himself
lucky he could still walk - he might not have believed how far he had
travelled with the throw, either. He felt at his aching throat. It
was painful to swallow. He was certain that beneath the lining of the
flight suit, there would be some rather pronounced bruising.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That man was dead!
Estelle shot him down! How the hell did he get back up?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Whilst Dodds was
silently considering everything that had just happened, Kelly was
voicing her opinions aloud. Enrique made his way over to reassure
her, as she pointed at the still corpse of the solider Chaz was
plundering. She looked a little hysterical, as if her worst fear of
dead bodies had at last been realised.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Is he really dead
now?” Kelly said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“He's dead,”
Enrique said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>Are
you sure?</I>”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, he is, calm
down.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“How do you know he's
not going to get back up again?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I don't think he'll
be getting up after that.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yeah, but we thought
that after Estelle put four damn bullets into him...”
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Are you okay,
Enrique,” Dodds asked above Kelly's ramblings, as he stumbled
forward.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Fine. Are you all
right?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He looked in the
direction of the two corpses on the floor by the locker. “I meant
what I said earlier: should bloody well have stayed in bed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What was that all
about?” Enrique wanted to know.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Don't know. I've got
about a hundred thousand questions, but answers that I could count on
one hand.” He realised his voice was shaking. But then, so was
everyone else's. “Did that really just happen?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Enrique nodded, an arm
around Kelly, rubbing her back. Dodds left them to it and made his
way over to where the solider had fallen. He caught a glimpse of what
remained of the man's head before turning away. He spotted some more
red-stained brass-coloured objects on the floor. Two more bullets;
that made three. He had no idea what might have happened to the
fourth. One hundred thousand and one.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz was still removing
things from the soldier. He had so far collected what looked like
four grenades and a fuel cell for the plasma pistol. Other items were
being tossed aside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Chaz, where's
the card? Did you get it?” Estelle asked through sharp intakes of
breath.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz continued to
search, ignoring her question.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Chaz?” Estelle
asked again louder, rubbing at her stomach.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>What</I><I>?</I>”
he roared, looking back at her, anger and impatience clear in his
eyes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Do not speak to me
that way, Lieutenant!” Estelle said, the stress causing her own
temper to flare. “Did you find the data card?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz tossed the capsule
in her direction. She caught it and wiped the remains of the blood
away, revealing the contents. She caught Dodds' eye and held it up as
if requiring a second opinion. He nodded; he could see the small blue
card within was marked with the Confederation insignia.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Right, we've got
what we came for,” she stated, and began to secure it in her flight
suit. “I think what it might be worth us doing is trying to
contact...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What we <I>have</I>
to do is get out of here <I>now</I>,”
Chaz said, snatching up the items he had removed from the soldier's
body and stuffing them into various compartments and pockets of his
own flight suit. “Enrique: how many more did you see?” he asked
as he set about retrieving the shotgun from where it lay under a
gurney.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Four, maybe five,”
Enrique said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz swore, then looked
around the morgue, his face becoming quite grim. “Doesn't
look like there is any way out of here except for the way we came
in.” He glanced at the shotgun in his hand and then turned back to
the group, his eyes flickering over each of them. He then turned back
to Enrique. “Do you know how to use one of these?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sure,” Enrique
said. “I've done my fair share on the firing range.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz tossed the shotgun
to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Magazine holds seven
rounds, but it has a low effective range, so anything over about
twenty-five meters is hardly going to be worth shooting at;
especially if you don't have
a steady aim. Don't waste it
on pot-shots, it won't do us
any good. Only use it when I tell you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The tone in his voice
let Dodds know this was far more than just a mere suggestion. Enrique
nodded as he began to familiarize himself with the handling of the
weapon, turning it over and bouncing it in his hands to feel the
weight. Dodds looked at Chaz in confusion. It seemed that the big man
knew a lot more than he was willing to let on, but quite why, he
didn't know. His usual silent and steady demeanour had abandoned him,
and Dodds wondered if they were now seeing his true colours.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds pointed at the
body. “Chaz, that guy...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Do you really want
to stand around and talk about this now?” Chaz said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds didn't.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Right, everyone
ready?” Chaz asked, as he started off to retrieve his equipment.
“We're not exactly going to have an easy time getting out of here
in one piece.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Lieutenant, what the
hell!” Estelle snapped, a furious expression on her face. “Don't
make me remind you who is in charge of this mission, Mr Koonan! I am
a <I>first</I> lieutenant,
you are a <I>second</I>
lieutenant; I am the wing commander of the <I>White
Knights</I> and I won't
have you giving orders to my team whilst...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds reached out and
took a grip of her shoulder, prompting her to stop talking.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Estelle, I really
feel that right now we should be listening to Chaz,” he said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle glared back at
Dodds before her eyes strayed to the body of the dead soldier on the
floor. She stood in silence for a time, looking from Dodds, to Chaz,
to the body. She then shrugged Dodds' hand from her shoulder.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Fine, we'll
follow your lead, Chaz,” she said with reluctance. “For now. But
once we get out of here, you will have a lot of explaining to do.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz acknowledged her
with a mere nod of his head before the <I>Knights</I>
retrieved their gear and made their way from the mortuary. On the way
out Chaz paused, and then turned around and walked back to Barber's
gurney. He picked the linen sheet off the floor and spread it back
over her body, bending down to give her a kiss on the forehead before
covering her completely.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds studied him as he
did all of this, but Chaz gave no explanation for his actions; and
neither did Dodds seek to ask.</P>

<B STYLE="font-size:1.16em;">T</B>he
infirmary lay still and quiet, and as Dodds continued his slow,
crouched walk towards the main door, he was confident that they were
alone. At Chaz's
request, he and Enrique had sneaked forward, leading the group
towards the medical unit exit. Chaz had covered their backs, keeping
Estelle and Kelly with him. Dodds and Enrique moved to either side of
the door, signalling the all-clear to Chaz, who hurried forward with
the two women.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds noticed that the
light on the control panel on this side of the door was blinking on
and off and guessed that the lock he had engaged earlier was no
longer in effect. Judging by what had just happened in the morgue, it
would not have stood up to anything more than a shoulder barge from
their attacker.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
That whole sequence was
still quite vivid in his mind: had it really happened? Were they all
really here, crawling out of a morgue where they had just cut open a
dead woman and fought a man who had somehow come back to life?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“See anything?”
Chaz asked Dodds and Enrique in a low tone.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds rose and took a
cautious peek out the circular infirmary door windows. The central
hall appeared a great deal darker than when they had first arrived.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Nothing,” he said,
choosing not to linger by the window any longer than was necessary.
“But it looks like a number of lights have blown.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, the soldiers
have shot them out,” Chaz said with a shake of his head. “They do
that so that it makes it harder for their enemies to see where
they're going.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds nodded, quite
willing to accept just about anything the big man told them.
Questions could wait until later.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Take a step outside,
carefully. Keep low and don't
make any noise.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“OK,” Dodds nodded.
He pushed at the door, but found it almost impossible to move, as if
there was a lot of weight in front of it. Enrique came to his aid and
between them they managed to open the door just wide enough for Dodds
to squeeze through, the bulky propulsion pack on his back making it
more awkward than normal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As he stepped out into
the darkened main hall, his boot slid on something. He looked down
and saw he was standing in a pool of blood. The mass that had been
holding back the door was a rather large woman, who had died as a
result of multiple plasma wounds to the torso. Her dead eyes gazed
straight ahead into the rest of the main hall. The hall was not as
dark as Dodds had first thought and as he followed her gaze he became
aware of the fate of the refugees. What he had first believed to be
the random scatterings of abandoned coats and luggage, were in fact
dead bodies. Dozens of them. Men, women and children lay all about
the floor. If it were not for the terrible wounds and the blood,
Dodds might have thought that they had all fallen victim to some
mysterious plague. As the hideous smell of burnt flesh started to
fill his nostrils, Dodds pulled himself back through the door.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What did you see?”
Enrique asked in a low voice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“They're
all dead,” Dodds said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Who?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“The refugees.
They've all been killed.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Did you see any
soldiers?” Chaz cut in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No,” Dodds said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz forced himself out
the narrow gap to take a look for himself, before returning back to
the corridor and confirming that the hall was clear of danger; though
there was much evidence of the slaughter that had taken place. At
this point, Chaz concluded that they would simply have to make a run
for it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He slipped through the
door and then beckoned for the others to follow, telling them to stay
low and stay quiet. In a line, headed up by Chaz, they walked as fast
as they could in their crouched positions, keeping the wall of
desolate coffee shops and other stores to their backs. The air was
heavy with the stench of burnt materials and flesh, and all five of
the <I>Knights</I>
did their best not to gag and cough with every breath they took.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
They looked all about
themselves as they moved, keeping an eye out for any sudden
appearance of the soldiers Enrique had mentioned. Glass and plastics
crunched loudly under their feet, as though wishing to expose their
position on purpose. They did not have all that far to go to return
to the airlock, but out in the open they would have little hope of
surprising their enemy, as they had done in the morgue. And this
time, they would be facing off against more than one of them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Halfway to the airlock,
the sound of running feet came from close by.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Down! Get down!”
Chaz hissed, waving a hand to the floor. “Keep still and don't
move!” The group dropped to the floor, lying on their stomachs
among the dead, the propulsion packs on their backs making it
difficult to assume any other position.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As Dodds lay in wait,
his eyes fell on two faces that were within his line of sight. One
was that of a young woman, the other an older man, somewhere in his
late thirties or early forties. Dark patches of blood were splattered
about their expressions, mixed in with the woman's blonde hair and
the man's black. Their eyes were wide, their faces twisted in terror.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds was reminded of a
scene from not long ago. He found himself thinking of Poppy and
Stefan, and a feeling of guilt rumbled up his spine. <I>Don't
look at them</I>, he told himself. But he did anyway, and for
a time he was unable to tear his eyes away from them. He found
himself wishing to tell them he was sorry; that it had been a
terrible accident; that if he could turn back time, he would do
things differently. He blotted the thoughts from his mind as the
sound of hurrying feet grew louder; and before long, the source
appeared.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
A man and woman came
running down a non-moving escalator from the first floor, where a
number of other restaurants, bars and sleeping areas existed. The man
was half dragging, half pulling the woman along behind him as the two
attempted to escape their pursuers. They would have been better off
running without holding hands, but it was clear that the man wanted
to keep the woman with him, fearing that they might become separated.
They stumbled a number of times on their way down the static
escalator, but managed to keep themselves on their feet; even at the
great speed they were descending, taking the steps two or three at a
time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Loud voices followed
and then a pair of black figures appeared by the first floor
railings. Two of the soldiers! One raised a rifle and fired with
clinical accuracy, two blots of plasma striking the escaping woman in
the back as the couple tried in vain to flee. She screamed and
tumbled to the floor, her partner losing his grip on her hand.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Out of the corners of
his eyes, Dodds saw his fellow team mates tense as he did, though
they remained motionless on the floor, reluctant witnesses to the
scene.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With their pursuers
bounding down the escalator after them, the man attempted to pull the
woman to her feet. She wobbled as she tried to stand, and as she did
so, she revealed that her clothing had been burnt away around the two
spots on her back where she had been hit, hideous blackened and
charred flesh visible beneath. The man could not help her to stand
quick enough and he looked up to see one of the two soldiers bearing
down on him. He was hit square in the chest by two rounds of his own
and was dead even before he hit the floor, the bolts carving their
way straight through him. Having ignored the woman in preference to
taking out the man, the soldiers finally dispatched her, seemingly
unmoved by her sobs and pleas for mercy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
A few moments later,
there were more hurried footsteps and the remaining three soldiers
that Enrique had described seeing came running into the scene, to
join with those standing over their latest victims. They began to
converse, one pointing back the way they had come, others examining
their weaponry.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds studied them as
they spoke to one another, listening to their words. It was not a
language he had ever heard before and a nagging feeling grew within
him that it wasn't normal. He tried to convince himself that it was
an Imperial dialect that he was unfamiliar with, but the
characteristics of the tongue were all wrong. It sounded almost angry
and mechanical, even though there was a strong central Imperial
accent present in each spoken word.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
These five soldiers all
sported a number of different armaments, like the one they had
encountered in the morgue. As well as the weapon each held in their
hands, they also had a rifle slung over their backs. Some also had an
additional pistol holstered to their right legs. Again, like the
soldier they had fought in the mortuary, they all appeared to be a
lot taller than normal and in excellent physical condition. There
also appeared to be two women in the group. They were more slender
than the three others, but just as tall. Something in the back of
Dodds' mind told him that
they were also as strong and dangerous as the men. Their suits hugged
their bodies well, showing off all their perfectly-proportioned
curves. They, too, looked like models.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds hoped that the
soldiers would leave the area now that they had eliminated their
targets; or, better still, that once they had finished speaking, they
would depart the starport and head back to where they had come from.
But as they spoke, one of the soldiers gestured to the bodies on the
floor and then pointed in the direction of the medical unit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>You</I><I>'</I><I>re
missing your friend!</I> Dodds thought. <I>He
hasn</I><I>'</I><I>t
checked back in!</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The troops began to
scout the area, nudging and kicking over bodies as they went. For a
moment, Dodds wondered what they were doing. Understanding then hit
him like a sledgehammer and he had to stifle a yelp, forcing himself
not to panic. He fought the compulsion to turn to the others and work
out a plan.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As it was kicked, one
of the corpses let out a grunt, the noise telling all within earshot
that it was in fact playing dead. The “corpse” then rolled over
and the man scrambled to his feet. Its investigator reacted quickly
to the sudden movement and shot him down. The man cried as a second
and third shot struck him, and then fell down silent. The four other
soldiers paused for a moment in their own hunt, before returning to
their rounds.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Oh my god...”
Dodds heard Kelly squeak.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He concurred. The
black-suited soldiers continued to nudge and kick the fallen, drawing
a pistol every now and again and shooting a body to guarantee it was
not also playing dead. Their persistence met with success on another
two occasions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds shifted his eyes
to where Estelle lay next to him, seeing her almost as stiff as a
board, though shivering ever so slightly. He couldn't be sure whether
it was due to fear or the cool of the station; though, from the way
he felt, he was certain it was the former. He then shifted his eyes
over to Chaz, wondering what suggestions the big man was going to
make.</P>

Chaz studied the dark
troop as they moved about, making a full evaluation of the situation
before making his move. From the looks of things, it would not be
long before they made their way over towards where the <I>Knights</I>
were concealing themselves. He would have to act soon. Chaz
re-evaluated what he had removed from the downed soldier in the
morgue: to their name, the five Confederation pilots had one shotgun,
with only a handful of shells; a near-full plasma pistol, but with
only one spare fuel cell; and three smoke grenades and two regular
ones. This did not bode well for them; not in comparison with the
enemy's armament of numerous
shotguns, plasma rifles, pistols, grenades and God only knew whatever
else. He had been quite stunned at how poorly equipped the invader
had been. Either he had been acting as a scout, or he had exhausted
much of his ammunition before coming in search of them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz noticed that
Estelle had shifted her position and was looking at him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>Chaz,
come on! What do we do?</I> her eyes cried. <I>We
have to get out of here! NOW!</I></P>

“When I say move, get
into that bar over there - The Lodge.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds almost jumped at
the sound of the big man's voice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Find decent cover,
away from the entrance.” As Chaz finished speaking, one of the
soldiers' heads snapped around to face in their direction, a pair of
ruby-red eyes falling upon the group.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>He
could </I>not<I>
have heard that!</I> Dodds thought. <I>He</I><I>'</I><I>s
too bloody far away!</I>
The big man had spoken just loud enough so that Enrique and Kelly
would not have difficulty in hearing the whole sentence, but not
enough to project his voice to the five black-suited soldiers. To his
mind, it was not possible to have heard him over that distance. Even
so, it appeared he had been.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Enrique, you ready?”
Chaz asked out of the corner of his mouth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Just tell me what to
do,” Enrique said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Get ready to shoot.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The tall soldier had
broken off from his systematic sweep and was heading over in their
direction. Dodds watched as the soldier walked towards them, holding
his breath and not even daring to blink. As he approached, the
soldier tapped at the side of his helmet, around the same area that
Dodds had noticed the button-like indent. He scanned over the bodies
for a moment and then appeared to focus on something. He was looking
at the flight helmets. After a few seconds, he tapped his helmet
again and hoisted his weapon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“NOW!” Chaz
shouted. The noise caught the soldier off-guard and he swung his
weapon around toward Chaz.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
At the same time,
Enrique brought himself up into a prone position, raising the shotgun
off the ground. It had been a long time since he had used a weapon
like this, and that, coupled with the lack of time to aim, did not
inspire him with much confidence. The proximity of soldier and nature
of the weapon, however, meant that he had little to worry about. His
finger pulled back on the trigger, discharging the shotgun and
sending pellets flying straight into his target's
legs. The soldier roared in agony and buckled down, the sudden and
intense pain making him lose his grip on his own weapon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Move!” Chaz
ordered, springing to his feet as the sudden noise and activity
focused the attentions of the other soldiers. Dodds, Estelle and
Kelly snatched up their flight helmets and dived into the bar as Chaz
capitalised on the surprise attack. He fired the plasma pistol
randomly at the other soldiers, causing them to scurry for cover.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Residing in the middle
of the central hall was a large oval desk, that at one point in time
had served to provide visitors to the port with information, help and
a point of contact for the port's
management and security. They ducked behind it, the solid structure
of the reception providing them with protection against the
Confederation pilots.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz began to fall back
to the bar, still firing on the four soldiers and preparing to move a
lot faster once they decided to return fire. Enrique was on his feet
and moving back to join him. In front of them, their first target had
regained his composure and was bringing his weapon back around
towards the two men once more. Enrique took note and emptied another
round into him, knocking him down onto his back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Don't
waste it!” Chaz urged as they retreated into the bar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
They took up positions
close to the front, using the walls for cover against the rain of
return fire. Bottles and glasses that had not already been broken and
looted by the refugees shattered behind them, as they were struck by
bullets and plasma bolts. Chaz chanced a glance around the pillar he
stood behind and snatched back as plasma fire slammed into it, inches
from his face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What's
the plan, Chaz?” Estelle called from her hiding spot behind the
bar's counter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm
working on it,” Chaz said through gritted teeth, taking a hasty
look outside the bar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Another of the soldiers
had hurried forward to aid his fallen comrade whilst the others laid
down suppressing fire. Chaz risked a number of potshots, but it did
little to disperse them. He saw the soldier take hold of his ally by
the forearm and begin to effortlessly pull him backward, bumping over
and parting the bodies of the refugees that lay in their way.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Enrique, those two!”
Chaz said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Enrique leaned round
the pillar wall and took a snap shot at the two retreating men. He
did not find as much success as he had before, only winging the
rescuer on the shoulder. The man staggered back, releasing his grip.
Though only a few seconds following the interruption, the soldier
continued to pull his ally out of the way with his other arm, unfazed
by the attempt on his life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm
nearly out,” Enrique announced as he sank back down against the
wall and checked his ammunition. Chaz tossed him over the remaining
shells.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“He's
getting up!” Dodds said. From his own hiding place, Dodds had a
good view of the scene within the central hall, and watched in horror
as the man that Enrique had emptied two shotgun rounds into began
getting to his feet. Dodds had only just convinced himself that the
first soldier they had downed in the morgue had received nothing more
than flesh wounds, the bullets Estelle had fired being slowed by the
man's leather suit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The reality of what
they were up against had finally begun to sink in, and the cries of
the pilot that Estelle had shot down three days ago came rushing back
into his head. The pilot had begged not to be sent back, that if he
went back he would die. Now that Dodds thought about it, the man had
spoken with an Imperial accent. He had thought nothing of it at the
time, but now... Was this what those three had been running from? Had
they been so desperate to escape from this nightmare that they would
risk going head-to-head with seasoned Confederation starfighter
pilots? The odds of their success had been low, but no doubt higher
than their odds against these soldiers. The “rumours” he, Enrique
and Chaz had heard the previous night no longer seemed to be just
that.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Something else occurred
to him: was this how <I>Dragon</I>
had been so easily overcome? From what he was seeing, even the
several thousand strong crew of <I>Dragon</I>'s
full complement would be no match against such unrelenting foes. What
other secrets were the CSN keeping from them?</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He looked to Chaz, who
was sheltering from the bullets and plasma that continued to fly into
the bar, ripping plaster and chunks of concrete from the walls;
splintering wooden chairs, tables and the counter; shattering
bottles, glasses and decorations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He caught Chaz's eyes.
The man looked stressed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Chaz, seriously, who
the hell are these guys?” Dodds asked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
There was considerable
pause, then, in a grim voice, “They're the result of the Senate's
desire to control the Empire. They're a mistake.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What?” Dodds said.
“They're a <I>mistake</I>?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
More wood and plaster
flew. Enrique swore, his voice loud above the other noise.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What do you mean?
Are they human?” Dodds said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds was staring at
him, but Chaz took no notice, lost in thought as to how they were to
escape from their current predicament. He checked the counter on his
plasma pistol and saw that only two shots in the current fuel cell
remained. Shooting down the enemy was now not an option - if it had
ever been. He ducked out of hiding again, to loose off the final two
shots before crouching down behind the wall to reload the pistol. He
tossed the empty fuel cell away, the little splash it made as it hit
the floor grabbing his attention for the first time. It was then that
he noticed the thin liquid that covered the floor, as well as the
strong smell of wine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Estelle, what you
two got back there?” he shouted to the two women taking refuge
behind the counter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We don't
have any weapons or ammo!” Estelle said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Not unless you want
to start throwing beer glasses at them!” Kelly added.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Anything with a high
percentage of alcohol?” Chaz said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“They're
starting to come around!” Enrique cried. At their current range,
Enrique's shotgun was not
going to be as accurate or effective against the soldiers as the
pistol. He fired it nonetheless, in an attempt to keep the soldiers
together, though they had already split into two groups and had begun
to circle around, to take the bar blindsided.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz took a chance and
fully exposed himself, firing off several shots at both groups to
drive them back. The gamble paid off and the soldiers once again
pulled back for cover. He sought cover once more himself, knowing
that he would not be able to pull off such a move again. He counted
himself lucky that he had not been shot to ribbons, even for those
brief few seconds. The soldiers were not only very accurate, but also
possessed incredible reflexes. He assumed they must have already used
up their more powerful armaments dealing with the refugees; he would
not be safe behind the wall otherwise. It had bought them a little
time, but even that was already beginning to run out.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Found anything?”
Chaz called.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle and Kelly were
ransacking the lower cupboards, looking for anything that might be of
use.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Vodka,” Kelly
volunteered, her eyes resting on some large clear bottles of liquid
labelled <I>Velda</I>.
“Lots of it.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Bring it here - and
hurry!” Chaz said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Estelle thrust two of
the large bottles into Kelly's
arms and the woman somewhat reluctantly crawled towards Chaz, pausing
under wooden tables as she went.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“How many are there?”
the big man said, as she pulled herself up next to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“About two dozen or
so under the counter,” she said. “Maybe more if...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Toss them out
there,” Chaz said. “Take the caps off and try and make sure they
break. Make sure you get a good spread. Estelle, Dodds pass her the
rest. Enrique and I will cover you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The others started to
follow his request, without question. Chaz fired the pistol sparingly
as they did so, keeping a close watch on the ammunition counter as he
and Enrique continued to lay down a suppressing fire.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As the bottles were
thrown out, smashing on the white marble floor, the black soldiers
ceased firing and held their position behind the massive desk. They
seemed uncertain of what was going on and why their enemy had
resorted to such a bizarre tactic. Such feelings were shared by
Dodds, Estelle and Kelly who were, at this point, willing to try
anything to get out of the port alive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Only got one shot
left,” Enrique said, at the same time that the bottles of vodka ran
out. All the bottles had shattered where they had been thrown, the
alcohol spreading out across the floor and soaking into the clothes
of the dead.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Pass it over here,”
Chaz said, still not willing to explain or discuss his train of
thought with the others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Enrique ducked down and
slid the weapon across the floor to the big man, who let it come to
rest next to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“When I give you the
signal, I want you all to get out of here and head towards the
airlock. Don't wait for me;
I'll be right behind you.”
He produced the three smoke grenades, double-checking that they were
what he was after. “Hold your breath.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Taking hold of the
first, he pulled the pin and let it roll away from him. The canister
immediately began to billow thick green smoke, filling the inside of
the bar. Setting off another, he tossed it just outside the entrance
to the bar, yellow smoke belching forth and beginning to cover the
surrounding area. He then threw the third in the direction they would
need to take to reach the airlock, purple smoke spewing out of the
canister.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Go! Now!” Chaz
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He watched as his four
allies made their way past him, the air all around them filling with
multicoloured gas. The combination of the three grenades in the small
area was already providing an effective screen for their escape, but
Chaz knew this was not enough. Dropping the plasma pistol into his
flight helmet, he tossed the shotgun outside the bar, where he could
more easily retrieve it following the final phase of his plan.</P>

As the smoke screen
covered the <I>Knights,</I>
the soldiers tapped at the side of their helmets, changing the
internal visor settings; a tactic they had used whilst hunting down
escaping refugees in the near-darkness that the soldiers themselves
had perpetuated. They had since returned their visors to normal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
But with the thick
blanket of smoke now obscuring their vision, they chose a setting
that allowed them to see thermal radiation. The smoke screen that had
been providing the <I>Knights</I>
with cover for their escape was undone, and their forms were revealed
as silhouettes of red, yellow and blue-green hues, running as best
they could from the bar in the direction of the airlock corridor,
skipping over bodies.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
All that was, except
for one, who remained outside the entrance of the shot up bar. The
silhouette did not stay in that position for very long, however,
making a sudden throwing motion and then beginning to run itself,
grabbing two objects off the floor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Training their guns on
the figure, the soldiers prepared to open fire when their vision
exploded, overwhelmed with an intensity of reds, oranges and yellows.
The definition of their surroundings was lost. They did not need to
switch off their thermal vision to realise that a fierce blaze had
sprung up between them and their quarry. It was now spreading fast,
the fire setting alight to clothes and other flammable items that had
at one time belonged to the refugees.</P>

The combination of
thick, multicoloured smoke and flames provided the <I>Knights</I>
with adequate cover and the group reached the airlock unscathed.
Reaching the door first, Dodds started to work the control panel,
opening it and allowing the others through. He remained in front of
the panel as the others made their way into the chamber, lest it
close and leave some of them on the wrong side of the thick doors. He
saw Chaz bringing up the rear and waved him through. With him, the
big man carried the shotgun that he had originally entrusted to
Enrique, as well as his flight helmet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Dodds, get in here!”
Estelle said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds released his
finger from the button and started forward, only to feel something
latched onto his leg. He looked down to see that one of the soldier's
previous victims was not yet dead and was now clinging on to him for
dear life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Hey! Let go!” he
started, trying to shake the man off him. Despite his efforts, the
refugee held on tight, refusing to do as he said, the desperation to
escape and reach safety all but closing his ears to any such protest.
Dodds began to swear profusely, and reached down in an attempt to pry
the man from him. He could feel that he would topple over at any
moment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Pandoran!
Pandoran...” the man said, looking back around him in fear,
hearing, as Dodds, the sound of the soldiers'
heavy boots on the floor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Help!” Dodds said,
looking around to his allies in the chamber, who were affixing their
helmets and checking their gear. The refugee was attempting to pull
himself up, repeating the same word over and over. It sounded more
like a name.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Chaz came rushing back
out the airlock chamber, coming up beside the grappling pair. The big
man struck the refugee with the butt of the shotgun, making him
release his grip, before grabbing Dodds by the upper arm and hauling
him in to join the others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Close the damn
door!” Chaz barked, as the five black-clad soldiers rounded the
corner at the end of the corridor and hammered towards them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As the airlock doors
began to close, Chaz raised the shotgun for one last time and
discharged it. The soldiers did not even halt as the gun was fired,
the frontmost pursuer being winged by the spread of pellets. She fell
backwards, but the others simply stepped over her, forming a
defensive line between their adversaries and their fallen team mate.
Through the diminishing gap, Chaz threw the shotgun back into the
corridor, just as the doors bolted before him. Picking up his flight
helmet from the floor, he extracted the pistol he had stowed within
it. The big man then proceeded to don his helmet, though he did not
turn his back on the scene on the other side of the door.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds did likewise,
powerless to do anything but stand and watch the fate of the refugee
that had tried to come with him. With few options open to him, the
refugee made a vain attempt at rushing the soldiers. The lead did not
bother to respond to the threat with his held weapon, but instead
grabbed the man around the top of his head with one massive hand.
Drawing a knife from his belt, he cut his attacker's throat in one
fluid and powerful movement, before letting him slip choking and
gasping to the floor. The remaining soldiers ran up to the closed
door and stood in front of it, the foremost raising the plasma rifle
they held and training it on Chaz through the airlock door window.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds watched in
wrapped silence. Even though the soldier could have killed Chaz with
a couple of shots, he was not about to pull the trigger and break the
glass. To do so would risk exposing the entire port to the vacuum of
space the moment the outer airlock door opened. But the soldier
waited still. If the outer door did not open, for any reason, whether
because of a mechanical failure or security violation, then Dodds was
certain he would not hesitate to pull the trigger. Even so, Chaz
remained where he was, acknowledging no-one else, his back to his
fellow <I>Knights</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
A warning alarm started
in the chamber, signalling both the impending depressurization and
Chaz's victory.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Here we go,”
Enrique announced to the sound of the outer door locks' release.
Dodds felt himself start to drift out and he made sure he had a good
grip on the control of his propulsion pack. He noticed how Chaz
continued to stare at the soldiers on the other side of the glass,
even as he floated out beyond the chamber. Dodds slowed himself,
catching sight of the big man's
expression and noting it to be one of pure hatred for the invaders.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He looked back to the
corridor and saw the soldier who had been marking the door snap their
gun back and turn back down the corridor with his team mates.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“They're
coming after us,” Chaz's voice came in his earpiece. “They're
not going to give up that easily.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Oh, hell! The
freighter's gone!” Kelly
said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds looked all around
himself, seeking to disprove her. Unfortunately, she was right. The
only visible vessel was one bearing the Imperial coat of arms, docked
onto the side of the port; likely being how the soldiers had entered.
They had all been relying on the freighter's presence to help them
get back into the cloaked ATAFs. But with their point of reference
gone, finding the invisible craft now seemed like an impossible task.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He tried to think. He
looked back to the starport and tried to trace a line from the
airlock to where the freighter might have been. But for all his
effort, he couldn't judge the distance or the heading; it was too
hard.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Chaz, what are you
doing?” he heard Estelle ask. He saw the big man was aiming the
plasma pistol, a small green bolt already streaking away from him.
There was no answer from Chaz, who seemed to be concentrating at the
task in hand.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He fired several more
shots, in seemly random locations. The three shots sailed unhindered
out into space. The man adjusted his aim to target a different
region, but, as before, the next two bolts also failed to land a
target. The next shot he fired also disappeared into the depths,
then, with his next attempt, his plan revealed itself to all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The plasma bolt found
its mark and, just as Parks had warned, the unmistakeable form of an
ATAF lit up before their eyes, the shielding reacting to the hit and
looking as if someone had thrown luminous green paint all over it.
There it remained but for a scant few seconds before it began to fade
from view.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“There!” Chaz said,
drawing everyone's attention
to the withering green ripples outlining the fighter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Stay here,”
Estelle ordered the others and sped over to the fighter before
starting to ease herself through the shielding. Despite the need to
re-enter the fighter as quick as she could to assist the others, she
had to take her time pushing herself through the layers of tough
protection; a task that could not be accomplished without patience.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Before long, she
disappeared from view. A short while later, the fighter she entered
was lit with waves of cyan ripples, blue bolts streaking out from the
nose of the craft. They hurtled forward, striking objects not far
away, revealing themselves to be the four other ATAFs. Estelle was
using the mag cannons; she wasn't about to dare using the main guns –
they could do more harm than good.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds sped over to the
nearest visible craft to him and, just as Estelle had done, started
pushing himself through the starfighters'
shielding, all the while glancing uneasily back at the Imperial
lander that was still latched onto the side of the port. At any
moment, it could detach itself and start after them. He was surprised
it was taking them this long.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He guessed that the
soldiers...</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:center; text-decoration: none">

...
had encountered refugees that had escaped their
attention before and wanted to finish the job before giving chase,
even if the airlock escapees were of a greater threat. He was soon
settled back into the seat of the ATAF and began stabbing at the
buttons and controls in front of him, bringing the systems back
on-line.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Everyone ready?”
Estelle said. There was a resounding confirmation from all and, as
one, the <I>Knights</I>
turned their still veiled ATAFs around and moved away from the
starport, and back towards <I>Griffin</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
An explosion reflected
off Dodds' canopy and he looked around to see the transport craft
that had been attached to the port had been destroyed. The port began
to vent air, bodies, and other materials as it depressurized. A black
body spun out of the hole that had been ripped in the side of the
port, in wake of the transporter's
destruction. The figure made futile attempts to stop itself from
drifting further into space, but was unable to do anything about
their slide.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds caught the green
outline of an ATAF just as it faded from view, swinging around to
rejoin the group.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Just making sure,”
Chaz said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As they hurtled away
from the port, Dodds looked back around to see that the black-suited
body of the soldier was still moving, a lot longer than should have
been possible. In his mind's
eye, frightening images were painted:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>Though
the ATAF was invisible, the soldier began to swim through space
towards him, gaining on him despite the incredible speed of his
starfighter. After all, what was the lack of oxygen and warmth to one
who had survived injuries that would have killed an ordinary human
being? Latching onto the ATAF's
canopy, it punched straight through to him, the shields and the
canopy itself no match for its incredible strength. The soldier
grabbed him by his flight suit, wrenching him from his seat and out
into space, the buckles doing nothing to save him. Drawing again on
its unimaginable strength, the soldier punched easier through his
flight helmet, shattering the tough visor and draining away all his
oxygen. There it held him in an unbreakable grasp, waiting for him to
die; until finally releasing him and leaving his lifeless body to
float through space forever, his friends able to do nothing more than
look on in horror.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The soldier's
limbs did eventually cease their flailing, but by then Dodds was not
surprised by what he had seen. It would not have been a shock to him
if it had made an attempt to chase them, cloaked or not.</P>

“He would make an
excellent politician,” Estelle said to Dodds. She had spent some of
the journey back to the carrier questioning Chaz and attempting to
ascertain an explanation for his behaviour at the starport. As
expected, he was not very forthcoming with answers and Estelle had
soon given up. She would get the explanation she was after once she
had submitted a report. No doubt senior command would be very
interested in Chaz's actions
themselves and in the end she would get closure; even if it took
several months.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Managed to answer
the question without actually answering it?” Dodds said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Precisely.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm
just grateful to get out of there.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He too had many
questions of his own, none that he knew would be answered any time
soon. Most worrisome of all, Chaz's statement: <I>They're
a mistake.</I>
If that was a mistake, he didn't want to think what the original
intention was supposed to be. The past few hours
had been unlike any he had experienced in his entire life.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The journey continued
in relative silence, the five pilots happy to take a breather from
their recent experiences. Heading back to <I>Griffin,</I>
Dodds felt as though he was waking from a terrible nightmare; albeit
one with many memorable cuts and bruises.</P>

“<B STYLE="font-size:1.16em;">C</B>aptain.”</P>
<P CLASS="western">
	Parks looked up from
his musings, to see Liu swing around in his chair, wearing a relieved
expression.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Scanners are
indicating that <I>CSN
I</I><I>frit</I>
has just jumped into the system and has started making its way toward
our position. Based on their current velocity, they'll
be with us in a little under thirty minutes.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks joined the
helmsman by his console. Sure enough, the medium-range radar was
showing a green triangle moving towards the centre of the display.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Thank God,” Parks
said. He felt some of the pressure that had been weighing down upon
him starting to lift. In the hours following the <I>Knights</I>'
departure, Parks had overseen the crews'
efforts to bring the ship back up to a manageable, working condition.
It had not been easy, but with a lot of effort they had managed to
restore shields, engines, jump drives, and some weapons systems. And
whilst they would not be able to fend off any major attacks or launch
fighters, they were at least in a position to return home.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With the advent of
<I>Ifrit</I>'s
arrival, all that now remained was to await the <I>Knights'</I>
return and they could at last leave Phylent and
begin the journey home. Parks may not have managed to secure the
recapture of <I>Dragon</I>,
but he would have prevented valuable information from falling into
the hands of the Enemy. That, at least, was something to be thankful
for.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He turned to Weathers,
who had taken the place of O'Donnell
on the bridge. “How are the comms systems?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“They should all be
functioning correctly, sir,” Weathers said. “We are still
experiencing limited performance with shielding, weaponry and
engines, but communications are operating perfectly.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Good. Once <I>Ifrit</I>
is close enough, send them a welcome message on short-range broadcast
only. Relay our current situation to them and let them know we are
ready to leave as soon as the <I>White
Knights</I> return.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir,”
Weathers said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks returned to his
seat to await <I>Ifrit</I>'s
arrival. Their fellow Confederation carrier was travelling towards
them head-on and, from his seat, out the main viewport, he was able
to see various aspects of the ship springing into detail the closer
it grew to them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
But as <I>Ifrit</I>
bore down on <I>Griffin</I>'s
location, Parks started to grow uneasy and could not
shake the feeling that something was wrong. The carrier was well
within visual range, now less than about twenty kilometres out, and
devouring the distance at a rapid pace. From the looks of things, it
would be on top of them much sooner than Liu had at one time
predicted. He subconsciously sat a little more upright and further
forward in his seat.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks looked to
Weathers, “Karen, has <I>Ifrit</I>
acknowledged our HELO?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Not yet, sir. Should
I send it again?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No,” Parks shook
his head. “First, recheck the comms systems. Mr Liu, perform a full
system diagnostic. Let's be sure that our message was transmitted in
the first place before we begin bombarding them with repeat
broadcasts.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir,” Liu
said, then a minute later, “All tests have completed successfully.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Comms are still
functioning correctly, Captain,” Weathers added. “Though, it
might have been a glitch in the system.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks wasn't so sure.
Something wasn't right. “Send the greeting again,” he said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Weathers complied, but
there was still no answer. <I>Ifrit</I>'s
form continued to grow larger as it closed the distance between the
two carriers, showing no signs of slowing. It was barely a few
hundred meters from them now.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As Parks rose from his
seat and walked to the front of the bridge, he heard consoles up and
down the deck begin to whine, and knew right then that his worries
had been confirmed. He looked to Liu at the same moment the man
turned to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Captain, <I>Ifrit</I>
is readying weapons!” Liu said, the former look of relief wiped
clean and replaced by a picture of panic.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Red alert!” Parks
said. “Full power to shields now!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The words hadn't even
left his mouth when <I>Ifrit</I>'s
guns opened up, the full barrage directed
straight towards its almost defenceless former partner in battle.
Bright green light from bolts of plasma intermixed with thick red
beams of laser fire, the tiny blue and cyan particle trails of
missiles almost lost in between.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The opening volley hit
<I>Griffin</I>'s
shields hard and the already damaged power generators were quick to
buckle to the intensity of the onslaught. Parks found his seat just
as an enormous spray of bright blue splinters erupted from <I>Griffin</I>'s
bow, signalling both the collapse of the shielding and the
vulnerability of the vessel to the hail of fire that followed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Return fire!”
Parks barked. <I>For
what it</I><I>'</I><I>s
worth</I><I>.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>Griffin</I>'s
own cannons trained themselves on <I>Ifrit</I>,
but their efforts were futile at best, the carrier never having made
a full recovery from the battle hours earlier. The rate of return
fire <I>Griffin</I>
was able to muster was nothing compared to that which <I>Ifrit</I>
continued to pour on.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Explosions scorched the
bow and topside of <I>Griffin</I>,
the impacts of concentrated plasma fire ripping holes in the already
vulnerable hull. All about the ship, crew were thrown to the floor as
the carrier jerked with the unrelenting attack, Parks himself only
just managing to remain in his seat. The captain witnessed one of the
two plasma accelerators affixed to the front of the carrier explode,
the turret snapping apart and the mount breaking free and spinning
off into space. Green and blue chemicals vented from the shaft.
Missiles exploded all across the hull. Debris tumbled about from
where the attacks had shredded the more exposed and less well
protected parts of the vessel.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
If Parks had considered
his ship a mess before, then it was nothing compared to what he was
looking at now: the emblem of the griffin
residing across the topside of the carrier, stretching out away from
the bridge, was scarcely recognisable, now blackened and charred.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks braced himself.
He wondered how it might all end. Would he see the frontal viewport
shatter and be pulled from his chair, out into space? Would he feel
himself engulfed in flames for a few moments as the bridge exploded?
Or would he hear only a sudden loud bang, see his world go black, and
then no more? Whatever it was, he was sure he would find out soon...</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
And then, for the
second time that day, <I>Griffin</I>'s
lights shut off, plunging the ship into near-darkness. Computer
arrays and consoles followed in their stead. Some exploded, adding to
the causalities that had already built up during <I>Ifrit</I>'s
barrage, smoke once again threatening to fill the bridge and
suffocate its occupants.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Half-light spilled into
the bridge from the emergency systems, relieving the crew of the
momentary darkness. It was aided by the small electrical fires that
had sprung up from some of the consoles, creating a smoky orange
ambience about the bridge; pockets of flicking blue light from
sparking electrics dancing across consoles. Crew members darted about
to find firefighting equipment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With their power cut,
<I>Griffin</I>'s
weapons fell silent and Parks braced himself for <I>Ifrit</I>'s
impending finishing blow. It was then that he noticed that the
carrier had stopped rocking and that missiles and cannon fire no
longer rained down on the ship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Mr Liu...” Parks
started.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“They... they've
stopped firing,” Liu said, staring out at the Confederation carrier
that had moments before threatened to bring to an end <I>Griffin</I>'s
long service.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>Why?</I>
Parks wondered. When <I>Ifrit</I>
had ignored their greetings but continued forward, he knew something
was amiss. Though he had been grateful for the carrier's
arrival, going by the information that Turner had relayed to him
<I>Ifrit</I>
was many hours late. By now, he would be expecting to see <I>Leviathan</I>,
instead. <I>Dammit, Aiden, where
are you?!</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
“What's our status?”
he asked Liu.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Power outage is
temporary and is only affecting certain systems, Captain,” Liu
said, working at his console. “It can be restored in a few
minutes.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks hesitated for a
moment before responding to the news. “Don't
bring us back on-line, Lieutenant,” he said. Something told him
that it would not be wise for them to stop playing dead just yet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Weathers'
console started to jingle in front of her. “Sir, <I>Ifrit</I>
is attempting to establish communications,” she said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>So,
now they want to talk</I>, Parks thought. “Put them
on.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The holographic screen
sprang up at the front of the bridge, the quality of the picture and
sound comparable to how it had been just after the Imperial fighter
had crashed onto the flight deck. Parks heard a number of intakes of
breath as he stood up and walked closer to the projection of <I>Ifrit</I>'s
bridge. Whilst the image was blocky, jerky and suffering from
crackling audio, it lost none of the impact it otherwise stood to
deliver.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Zackaria sat in the
captain's
chair like a king upon his throne, his face serious and stern. Just
ahead of him, on his right-hand side, stood Hawke, his expression
deadpan in the face of his former ally.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Anthony...” Parks
began, the genuine shock in his voice clear even to him. With <I>Ifrit</I>'s
attack, Parks had thought of only two people who could be commanding
the carrier: Admiral Zackaria or Commodore Rissard. The thought of
Hawke alive and well and unharmed aboard the ship had never occurred
to him. And now, the sight of both Zackaria and Hawke stood side by
side, as allies, almost floored him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“This is where we
part ways, Elliott,” came the scratchy voice of Hawke from the
holographic image. “I just wanted to take this opportunity to bid
you farewell.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
His face had changed a
lot since Parks had seen him, hours before: his skin looked fresh and
healthy, his eyes were bright, and his facial hair was completely
absent, as if he had just had a clean shave.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“My God, man! What
are you doing?” Parks said, flabbergasted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“My part to ensure
the continued success of the Mission, Commodore,” Hawke said with a
clean expression. The man spoke in a matter-of-fact manner, as if
there was nothing unusual or surprising about his nature.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“The <I>Mission</I>?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Hawke nodded. Or, at
least, what appeared to be a nod. “The Mission - For the honour of
the Senate. For the glory of the Empire.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As Parks continued to
stare open-mouthed at the image that jumped, froze and tore, the
pieces of a great puzzle began to fall into place.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You gave them
<I>Dragon</I>,
didn't you?” Parks said.
“That's why you survived.
You tried to bargain and they took it. They wanted a man on the
inside.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Links formed in Parks'
mind, everything finally starting to make perfect sense: the Enemy
had intercepted and boarded <I>Dragon</I>
- how was not important - but he hazarded that
at that time it was not with Hawke's
consent. Though they had fought hard to hold back the invaders,
<I>Dragon</I>'s
crew had succumbed to the boarders and the Enemy had made their way
to Hawke himself. Something else had happened then, a point that
Parks still struggled on, but in the end it had led to Hawke's
treachery. The man had then been beaten, starved, and thrown into an
escape pod, where he was left to drift in Independent space for the
allied forces to find him. It was meant to look as though he had run
away or had been saved by his crew, so that he alone might be able to
tell of the fate that had befallen <I>Dragon</I>,
and therefore aid the Confederation in its recovery. But instead, he
had been working against them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
How much information
could he give them now, Parks wondered. What had he told them
already? That didn't matter; the Enemy had tricked him and they had
<I>Dragon</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“That is correct,
Commodore,” Hawke said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks'
mind raced, searching for a way out. The Enemy have <I>Dragon,</I>
and now they have <I>Ifrit</I>.
<I>Dragon</I>.
<I>Ifrit</I>.
Something occurred to him; he had to stall for time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Anthony, listen: we
can talk this through,” Parks said. “Please; allow me to come
aboard and speak with Admiral Zackaria. We can work something out. We
can end this without any more loss of life. I throw myself upon the
mercy of the Senate.” He knew it sounded absurd; so very
melodramatic.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“There will be no
discussions,” Hawke said in a flat voice. “There has been too
much talk already.” The holographic image had stopped updating, and
whilst the audio was still quite clear, the video transmission had
ceased.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks couldn't be
certain the same loss would be true for <I>Ifrit</I>,
but he had to risk it. He was sure that Hawke would continue his
gloat undeterred by the sudden loss of visuals. He just had to lure
him in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Your plans won't
work, Anthony,” Parks said. “There are too many flaws, too many
assumptions. We're already well prepared to exploit those
weaknesses...” He started to back away from the static holographic
image, beckoning towards Liu with one hand. The man rose from his
seat and prepared to assist the commodore as soon as he was prompted
further.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It will work just as
Fleet Admiral Turner described it,” Hawke said. “The ATAFs will
join our frontline forces and we will use them to fulfil the
Mission.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It's
not <I>your</I> Mission,
Anthony!” Parks retorted. “Listen to me: you are not one of
them.” He shuffled Weathers out of her seat, gesturing to the woman
to keep quiet. He quickly took her place, his fingers racing across
the surface of her console, Liu giving him visual prompts as the
man's plan began to come
together.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You are an enlisted
officer within the Confederation Stellar Navy,” Parks said. “You
have spent a good part of your life with the service and your time
and dedication to serving the Confederacy has not gone unnoticed. You
have a wife and one daughter, who has recently been accepted to study
law at Cambridge University, thanks to your own efforts to never give
up on her and motivate her to achieve her dreams.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“The Mission is more
important than any of those things,” Hawke's voice came. “All of
those who oppose the rule of the Senate must be eradicated, as
decreed by the Senior Magistrate. It's time for you to accept it: you
have failed, Commodore. You never were the man that Fleet Admiral
Turner believed you were. Too much store is put into the weak, into
the lenient, into the modest and the humble...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks did not hear the
rest, he was working too feverishly. He was thankful that Hawke had
taken the opportunity to gloat, though he knew that time was short,
and at any moment <I>Ifrit</I>
would finish <I>Griffin</I>
off. He heard a new voice speak over the comm link's
still active audio channel. The words were unrecognisable and seemed
not to be directed at him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Time's
up, Commodore,” Hawke announced.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Captain, <I>Ifrit</I>
is readying accelerators!” Weathers said from her position at Liu's
console.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
From where he sat,
Parks did not need computer readouts for that kind of information: at
this range, he could quite clearly see the green lights, running the
length of the weapons'
turrets, beginning to illuminate as they charged. <I>Griffin</I>
was mere seconds away from destruction.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks looked up from
the console, towards the carrier ahead where he knew both Hawke and
Zackaria would be staring back at <I>Griffin</I>,
preparing to witness its final few moments of service. Parks,
however, was not quite willing to give them that pleasure just yet.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You know how the
saying goes, Commodore: fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice...”
A single confirmation request lay on the console's
screen, Parks' fingers
hovering just above it. “... shame on me!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks'
fingers tapped the screen, executing the command he had taken the
opportunity to set up. <I>Ifrit</I>'s
plasma accelerators stopped charging, the lights along the turrets
extinguishing as if they were flames doused by water.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Karen?” Parks
looked to Weathers for further confirmation of his actions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>Ifrit</I>'s
shielding, weaponry and engines have all been disabled, sir,” she
said. “Life support still functional, but...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Bring us back
on-line, Mr Liu and get us out of here!” Parks interrupted, rising
from the console.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Where?” the
uncertain navigator said. “Jump engines are likely to be extremely
unstable since the last attack...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Just put some
distance between us, man!” Parks said. Whilst <I>Ifrit</I>
couldn't return fire or give
chase, Parks wanted to get <I>Griffin</I>
as far away as was possible. Not that he knew where they were going
to go or what they would do once <I>Ifrit</I>
recovered. He was buying time; clutching at straws.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>Griffin</I>'s
engines engaged and the carrier started forward, maintaining its same
heading and slipping beneath its antagonist, though it was clear that
the engines were lacking the power they had possessed at the time
they had departed Spirit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>I
can</I><I>'</I><I>t
believe that actually worked</I>, Parks found himself
thinking. The idea had come to him in a flash: upon seeing Zackaria
sat in the captain's seat on
the holographic screen, he had become angry at how the man had taken
not one, but now two of the Navy's
most prized vessels. He had gone back to the fateful start of the
day, to when, during the preparations, he had been certain they would
return home with what was once theirs. He then recalled how, prior to
the commencement of <I>Operation
Menelaus</I>, <I>Griffin</I>'s
databanks had been loaded with the security credentials for
deactivating <I>Dragon</I>.
The data bundle had, however, not been restricted to their mission
target and had also contained the protocols to link to other
Confederation capital ships; including <I>Ifrit</I>.
With the realisation that Hawke had inadvertently handed him the
advantage, Parks knew he had only to keep his former ally talking
until he could locate <I>Ifrit</I>'s
details.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Though he thought his
plan to be quite inspired, he was unable to revel in the victory; it
looked far too short-lived in his eyes. To Zackaria and Hawke this
was only a temporary set back and one way or another they would be on
<I>Griffin</I>
once more. And when that time came they would not hold back until the
carrier was reduced to nothing but a burnt-out shell.</P>

Zackaria rose from the
captain's chair, joining
Hawke where he stood at the front of the carrier and ordered him to
prevent the enemy's escape.
Hawke followed the orders through, assuring the admiral that <I>Griffin</I>
would not get far. Though <I>Ifrit</I>
could not follow or fire upon Parks'
ship itself, the Confederation fighters ready and waiting on the
flight deck were unaffected by the power outage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Black-clad figures
leapt up into fighters, that were quick to be taxied towards the
catapult; the speed and efficiency of the pilots and deck crew as
clinical as always. Within minutes, the first wing were starting to
hurtle down the launch tunnel, more and more fighters lining up
behind them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Hawke watched as the
first group of fighters shot out in front of the carrier, knowing
there was little chance that <I>Griffin</I>
would be able to outrun or fend off an assault from close to one
hundred simultaneous attackers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Even so, Hawke was
taking no chances and sent out further requests for backup.</P>

The TAFs, Rays and
Rooks began to spill fast from <I>Ifrit</I>
and wasted no time in giving chase to the
fleeing <I>Griffin</I>.
They closed the gap quickly, the first wing soon bringing themselves
into weapons range. The carrier was not moving fast, but even if it
had been in perfect working order it had no chance of outrunning
those pursuing it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With missiles already
locked on to the kilometre-long vessel ahead of him, the lead fighter
pilot poised over the trigger, waiting for the confirmation that his
target was in range. The seconds and meters ticked down; the range
confirmation flashed up on his HUD; he squeezed the trigger; his TAF
exploded.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The TAF next to him
fell at the same time, as did one of the following Rays and yet
another TAF, not far behind them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The pack of hijacked
Confederation fighters scattered like a frightened school of fish as
five sleek black craft appeared before them, seemingly out of
nowhere, and rushed straight at them, the tips of their cannons
blazing like flaming torches on a dark night.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Heads snapped around,
tracing the path of the mysterious craft and seeing them fan out as
they hit the rear of the pack.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As <I>Griffin</I>'s
pursuers attempted to reform their wing and once again focus their
efforts on the fleeing carrier, the new arrivals arced up and around,
and raced straight back at them, cannon fire spraying the squadron
indiscriminately. More of the TAFs, Rays and Rooks fell, despite the
pilots' attempts to evade the shower.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With their allies
dropping all about them, the squadron made a collective decision to
eliminate the threat before dealing with <I>Griffin</I>,
and broke off their pursuit. It was not long
before they realised what they were facing off against, many having
seen them before, only hours earlier.</P>

The news came quick to
Parks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>Griffin</I>;
this is Lieutenant de Winter, reporting mission accomplished,”
Estelle's voice came over
the bridge's comms system.
“Returning with five ATAFs, five pilots, and one mission target.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>White
Knights</I>!”
Parks said, almost unable to express the relief he felt at hearing
that the five had not only returned safe, sound and successful from
their mission, but had also stepped up to pull <I>Griffin</I>
out of the fire.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I must apologise for
cutting that a little fine, Commodore,” Estelle said. “I wanted
to better assess the situation and attempt to get the drop on <I>Ifrit</I>;
but I got a bit over-zealous, at your expense.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“There's
no need to apologise,” Parks said. “Your timing could not have
been more appropriate. I think it's
fair to say that our present situation speaks for itself. <I>Griffin</I>
needs cover whilst we retreat and work on a plan of action. Jump
engines are currently in an uncertain state, so an immediate
evacuation is not feasible.” <I>And
even if they were, we</I><I>'</I><I>re
not leaving just yet. Not without bringing Hawke and </I>Ifrit<I>
back in.</I>

Dodds was suffering a
range of emotions from the events of the day: he was hungry from not
having eaten since the breakfast he had picked at that morning, weary
from the lack of proper sleep, and sore from the encounter at Arlos.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The sight of <I>Ifrit</I>
opening fire on an allied carrier had resulted in all those emotions
clustering together and expelling themselves as pure anger. No-one
could have convinced him that Hawke was not in some way connected
with the attack. The urge to break away from the others and focus his
rage straight against <I>Ifrit</I>
had been almost uncontrollable. But he had bitten his tongue and
remained veiled and radio silent, as they had made their way back
towards <I>Griffin</I>;
until at last letting everything out the moment
Estelle had given them the order to attack. He had raced forward,
like a dog out of a trap, surging headlong into the wing of <I>Griffin</I>'s
unsuspecting attackers and taking down the lead with his opening
salvo.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“They learned to fly
those pretty damn quick,” Enrique said, pulling up to continue the
pursuit of his chosen target.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“They probably had a
lot of time to practice with the ones that Hawke loaned them,”
Dodds glowered, noting how the flyers of <I>Ifrit</I>'s
fighter complement were operating the Confederation craft with the
expertise of any seasoned CSN pilot.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The <I>Knights</I>
carried through Parks' orders, driving back the waves of fighters
they had earlier that day battled alongside. A hail of fire was
exchanged on both sides fighting between the two carriers, plasma
bolts drowning out the subtle cyan hues of the micro-missiles the
<I>Knights</I> loosed
against their opponents. And though their opponents made an admirable
show of fighting back, their efforts with the TAFs, Rays and Rooks
proved no more successful against the ATAFs than they had with the
Imperial Mantises, Jackals and Sphinxes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Are these guys even
<I>thinking</I> about
retreating?” Enrique wanted to know as he downed yet another
fighter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I don't
think they know what that means,” Kelly said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds brought himself
around to look upon <I>Ifrit</I>.
Fighters were still launching from the catapult and it appeared as
though the carrier's
hijackers were prepared to throw everything they could at the ATAF
pilots, in order to take down their targets. Despite the enemy pilots
having incurred great losses, they were undeterred in their task, and
it felt like no matter how many fighters Dodds brought down, several
more would appear to take their place.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>Ifrit</I>'s
gotta be exhausting its complement soon,” an exasperated Enrique
said several minutes later.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Not even close,”
Estelle said. “I don't think we've even hit the halfway mark yet.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“How many more of
them are there?!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Doesn't
matter,” Dodds said. “We'll
keep taking them on until there is nothing left but Hawke himself!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>Knights</I>,
concentrate only on the fighters. Do not open fire on <I>Ifrit</I>,”
Parks cut in. “We're not
leaving here without <I>Ifrit</I>.
I want to do everything in my power to bring her back home with us.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds suppressed a
growl and plunged forward into another wing, ignoring the hail of
fire that sped towards him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Several more exhausting
minutes of battle followed when, at last, the streams of fighters
leaving <I>Ifrit</I> began
to abate. They were no longer launching from the carrier with as much
gusto as they had at the beginning of the fight, and Dodds could only
guess that it was now taking longer to prep what remained of the
complement. It came as a relief; at last, it looked as though the day
was finally won.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He was about to ask how
Parks wished for them to deal with the still dead in the water <I>Ifrit</I>,
when a flash close by caused him to swallow his question. He then
swore as he saw Hawke's
backup arrive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Didn't
think it would be long before we saw that again,” he said, as out
of the portal slipped the enormous bulk of <I>CSN
D</I><I>ragon</I>.</P>

at the front of <I>Dragon</I>'s
bridge, Commodore Rissard looked first to the ATAFs striking down
<I>Ifrit</I>'s
fighter support, then to the escaping Confederation carrier far
beyond, still putting distance between itself and the battle area. He
gave no further thoughts to the whirling starfighters and ordered
<I>Dragon</I>
forward. <I>Ifrit</I>
needed no protection; not from the ATAFs and certainly not from
<I>Griffin</I>.
He knew that <I>Griffin</I>'s
captain would never seek to risk irreparable damage to the vessel, a
point that had been made clear to him when Hawke had called in <I>Dragon</I>
to assist them.</P>

“It's

Estelle said, as <I>Dragon</I>
powered forward.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>Ifrit</I>'s
back on-line,” Chaz added.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds noted that
running lights were once again dotting the carrier and that the ship
was turning to begin pursuit of its former ally in battle. He brought
his fighter about to look over the hulking mass of <I>Dragon</I>,
never before having been so close to the battleship in his life. He
was granted a close-up view of the graphic of a blue Chinese dragon
that spread itself across the hull, claws sunk in deep, jowls pulled
back, teeth snarling. The bow was already beginning to split, in
preparation to use the anti-matter cannon. He saw that the hijacked
Confederation fighters were breaking off, evacuating the target area
so that they would not risk being caught up in the fallout from the
assault.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He felt powerless.
There was nothing he could do to prevent <I>Dragon</I>'s
advance. His comms popped; it was Parks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“<I>Knights</I>,
what I'm about to ask is going to sound absurd... but I'm going to
have to request that you engage <I>Dragon</I>.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds swore, though his
words were lost within the collective gasps and words of disbelief
from his fellow wingmates.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You all witnessed
the power of that battleship's
main gun earlier,” Parks said, undeterred. “We cannot allow it to
gain a lock on us. If it does, then it's all over. I'm
going to enable the accelerators. Target and sweep the hull across
the vector I'm sending you.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sir..?” Estelle's
concerned voice came.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Don't panic, de
Winter: you will be targeting power systems only. There is no danger
of you destroying that ship.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>That's
not what she's worried about</I>, Dodds thought.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“The combined power
in those accelerators should be enough to break through the
shielding,” Parks added. “If you hit it right, then you'll knock
it off-line until the Imperial forces can effect repairs.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds looked over the
colossal battleship. Chaz's words came into his head, of how the
number of fighters the allied forces were bringing to the table were
no match for it. Back then, during the commencement of <I>Operation
Menelaus</I>, there had been several hundred. Now there were
five.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
But Parks was clearly
convinced that they had a chance of tackling <I>Dragon</I>.
Either that or the man was clutching at straws. And very brittle ones
at that. But what else could they do? They had to at least try. It
seemed that as much as the commodore wanted to recapture <I>Dragon</I>
with the minimum of damage, he no longer had a choice. The man had
long given up on the main objective of the operation that had begun
that morning, resigning himself to the fact that he would not be
retaking the Confederation flagship today.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds' console jingled.
The restriction on the accelerator had been lifted and Parks'
coordinates had been received. He glanced again to <I>Dragon</I>
and set to work utilizing the data and preparing the cannon. He then
swung his craft up and around, to bring himself in line with Estelle
and his fellow wingmates.</P>

Rissard watched as the
ATAFs changed their heading, breaking away from their engagements
with the Confederation fighters and brought themselves into a
staggered horizontal formation toward the battleship.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Unperturbed by their
sudden interest in his ship, he ordered that they be ignored, his
focus remaining on <I>Griffin</I>.
They could be captured once the carrier had been destroyed. He
prepared to give the order to fire, but found that his eyes were
inexplicably drawn back to the camera tracking the black
Confederation fighters. The ATAFs came into range...</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Moments later, a thick,
bright green stream of plasma erupted from the belly of the lead,
striking the broadside of <I>Dragon</I>.
Beams from the four others joined it, aiming for the same point.
There was a call from somewhere down the bridge - the shield
generators were struggling. The lead changed their heading, sweeping
the beam along the hull. Its path was followed by the four others,
who banked hard to trace the line. Against the concentrated plasma
beams, the shield quadrant held for only a few seconds before it
collapsed. Bright splinters erupted from <I>Dragon</I>'s
broadside, as though someone had just shot a cannon ball through a
huge stained glass window.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With the shield gone,
and with nothing to protect it, the beams proceeded to cut straight
into the hull, tearing open the armour as they went.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The black-suited crew
of <I>Dragon</I>
fell about as the battleship lurched violently from the assault.
Lights and operational computer arrays failed. Then the gravitational
systems failed. Rissard felt his feet lift off the floor of the
darkened bridge and he found him floating around helplessly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
By the time the ATAFs
had concluded their sweep, a large scar ran deep across <I>Dragon</I>'s
starboard side, venting gases, chemicals, and the splintered remnants
of protective armour plating. The graphic of the magnificent Chinese
dragon had become a shadow of its former self, a sordid blackened
mark running across it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
A short time later, the
emergency systems engaged and <I>Dragon</I>'s
occupants were sent crashing back to the ground. Rissard picked
himself up as the ATAFs swooped past the bridge's frontal viewport
and ordered the crew to resume their pursuit of <I>Griffin</I>.
His request was denied, reports coming in detailing the state of the
ship in wake of the attack: the main cannon lacked the power it
needed to fire, shielding and weaponry were now in an unreliable
state, the flight deck had suffered significant damage, and the power
generators were in need of repair.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">

watched the five starfighters pass by and ordered the repairs be made
at once.</P>

“That's
enough!” Estelle said, as they completed their run. “Get back on
the fighters!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds' scepticism of
Parks' plan had been high. He couldn't see any way in which it could
actually succeed. And yet it had! And as he pulled away from <I>Dragon</I>,
it looked for all intents and purposes that the battleship was no
longer able to participate in the battle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He had watched as the
accelerator beams had hit their target's shield, promising to do
little else but prove just how well-protected the legendary vessel
was. And then, as he had followed Estelle's lead, he had seen the
shield give way to the beams which had cut through into the hull.
They had sliced and torn and ripped their way through the armour,
cutting it apart like thin fabric.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He found it almost
impossible to tear his eyes away from what they had just achieved,
and again the questions about just what this craft was he was in
command of began to rise within him. Twenty-four hours earlier his
world had been a very different place.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
But now was not the
time to contemplate such things. He pushed them to the back of his
mind, turned away from the crippled battleship and started back
towards what remained of <I>Ifrit</I>'s
fighter complement. Now the battle <I>was</I>
won! The day was theirs! He was just separating out a target, when a
number of flashes drew his attention. He caught his breath; his jaw
dropped. From out of the fresh jump points emerged six Imperial
frigates, accompanied by a multitude of Imperial starfighters.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“oh my god,” he
gasped.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We could be about to
become unstuck here, guys,” Enrique said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds'
eyes darted from <I>Dragon</I>,
to <I>Ifrit</I>,
to <I>Griffin</I>,
to the frigates, to the fighters. He felt his world collapse, not
sure of how to begin dealing with the reinforcements.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Dear God, there's a
lot of them,” Kelly breathed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Doesn't
matter,” Estelle said. “We need to keep them away from <I>Griffin</I>!
Go to it, people!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds did as his wing
commander ordered, but his own personal feelings on the matter
mirrored those of Enrique and
Kelly. The incoming Imperial fighters squadrons was made up of
almost everything the INF possessed: Sphinxes, Mantises, Jackals,
Scarabs... He had never seen anything like it. And the numbers! They
were insurmountable! This was not an Imperial force that he knew of.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With a burst of speed,
the fighters accelerated away from the frigates they had been
escorting, aligning themselves with the sleek black starfighters and
almost defenceless <I>Griffin</I>
beyond. Weapon struts deployed from the egg-like body of the
Mantises, locking into place and presenting fully-loaded missile
hardpoints below.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds drove himself
into the huge squadron of fighters, the pack looking like so many
birds migrating all at once. He could not count the odds stacked
against them, suffice to say one thing was all too clear: the <I>Knights</I>
were now heavily outnumbered.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The frontline Imperial
fighters opened up with a full barrage against the five approaching
ATAFs, multicoloured light from various weapon fire reflecting off
the starfighter's armour as
it passed by them, all five of the <I>White
Knights</I><I>'</I>
crafts' shielding rippling
with the impact of the shots. Missiles from the backline followed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>There
are too many,</I> Dodds thought, only minutes into the
fight, feeling his zeal beginning to slip. Even so, he kept his mouth
shut, trying to focus himself better. The swarm of fighters on his
radar and outside his cockpit had become overwhelming. His intercom
was exploding with chatter, and every one of the voices was frantic,
urgent and very, very worried.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Many of the fighters
were striking <I>Griffin</I>
now. The carrier was making a valiant bid at protecting
herself, but with only its rear cannons still undamaged, the cracks
in its defence were all too wide.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds broke off his
engagement, pushing back through the cluster of adversaries and
towards the bombers that were of the greatest threat to the survival
of the carrier. His HUD tagged them with missiles and he loosed them
the instant they were locked. They were joined by a hail of plasma
fire from another ATAF that was quick to enter and leave his view. He
gave no thought to whom it may have been; nor did he seek to ask.
There simply wasn't time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The bombers fell. He
swung back around to the cluster of Imperial forces, trying hard to
overcome the sinking feeling that was consuming his every being. But
he couldn't shake it: this was it; this was where it was going to
end...</P>

Watching the bombers
fall and the <I>Knights</I>
re-focusing their efforts on keeping the next wave away from his
ship, Parks found himself stuck between a rock and a hard place. For
<I>Griffin
</I>to remain here would almost certainly lead to its
destruction, in the face of such overwhelming odds. On the other
hand, fleeing the system would not only be risky in <I>Griffin</I>'s
current state, but would leave <I>Ifrit</I>
in the hands of the Enemy. There was little doubt in his mind that it
would also condemn Meyers to the same fate when he arrived with
<I>Leviathan</I>,
coming to Parks' rescue.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As he saw the <I>Knights</I>
trying to cut down what seemed like an unending supply of Imperial
fighters still surrounding them like a swarm of angry wasps, Parks
came to a reluctant conclusion: he had lost. He would not be bringing
either <I>Dragon</I>
or <I>Ifrit</I>
back home with him today. His priority now was to ensure the safe
return of the ATAFs, the <I>Knights</I>,
and the plans to Confederation space. As of now, they were the most
important thing, more so than anyone else.</P>

“<I>Knights</I>,
fall back, we're going to
jump back to Spirit immediately,” Dodds heard Parks
over his fighter's
intercom.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sir, the enemy
forces could follow us...” Estelle started.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm
well aware of the risks, de Winter!” Parks interrupted. “Fall
back now! That's an order!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, sir,” Estelle
said, then to the team, “You heard the Commodore - Fall back!
Prepare to jump back to Spirit!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds complied, ceasing
his attack on the Imperial fighters and starting back towards
<I>Griffin</I>.
The others followed, plasma and laser fire chasing the retreating
ATAFs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
But as he headed toward
the carrier, seeing enemy fire streak past him and striking both
himself and his friends, he was reminded of a very similar situation
that had occurred some months back; and something inside him snapped.
He slowed and swung his fighter back around to face the pursuing
enemies, <I>Griffin</I>
and the other ATAFs falling out of his cockpit view.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Dodds, what the
hell?” Enrique said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Dodds, get back here
now!” Estelle called out to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds ignored her, as
well as the calls from the others to turn back around and return to
<I>Griffin</I>,
so that they might all depart the system whilst they still could. He
started to weave, dodge and twist his way through the swarm of
Imperial craft, surging closer to the six gathered frigates and the
enormous form of <I>Dragon</I>.
And it was not long before he was well within range of his target:
<I>Ifrit</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
With the cumulative
enemy fire focused on his ATAF alone, his defences had taken a
considerable beating during his approach. Not that it now mattered -
he was right where he wanted to be.</P>

“Dodds.” Hawke did
not need to be told who was piloting the ATAF that was streaking
towards <I>Ifrit</I>'s
bridge; he instinctively knew that only one man could be so arrogant
as to pull off such a manoeuvre when everyone else was falling back.
He barked an order to the crew to concentrate the carrier's
fire on the fighter, as the ATAF aligned itself with the bridge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
For a moment, Hawke's
eyes widened. It was going to ram them! At the same moment, a barrage
of fire issued from beneath the ATAF's
wings and sped towards the bridge's
viewport, almost right where the Imperial admiral and the former
Confederation commodore were standing. The bolts slammed headlong
into the bridge's frontal
shield quadrant, at first striking it like raindrops upon a sheet of
glass. A number of seconds later, the shield collapsed, unable to
withstand the continuous hail of fire being directed at it. The ATAF
pulled away from its collision course, its work done.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Hawke saw the bridge's
shield quadrant splinter for an instant before the remaining bolts
crashed unhindered into the bridge's
main viewport. Huge web-like cracks began to sprout at the points of
impact, and both he and Zackaria turned to evacuate the bridge while
they still could, the black-clad soldiers that occupied seats and
consoles springing up to follow them. The next instant, the last set
of bolts shattered the frontal viewport.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Hawke managed to steady
himself for but a fraction of a second before the tremendous force of
depressurisation yanked him backwards. He crashed into one of the
forward control consoles, fingers scrambling for purchase about the
long edge. A warning sounded on the bridge and a pair of large blast
screens starting to close, to contain the exposure.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Zackaria tumbled over
backwards, straight through the middle of the shattered window and
out into space, the blast screens coming too late to prevent his
departure. Hawke followed, losing his grip on the console that had at
one time promised to spare him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
More than half of the
bridge crew were condemned to the same fate as Zackaria and Hawke,
unable to prevent themselves from being jettisoned from the bridge.</P>

Liu looked up from his
console. “Sir, it appears both Admiral Zackaria and Commodore Hawke
have been spaced. Enemy forces have also ceased attacking.” He
sounded confused.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Bring us about,”
Parks said, wanting to see for himself. The carrier turned back to
face the enemy forces, and as the numerous capital ships and fighters
came into view, Parks saw that the scene had become a good deal
calmer than the chaos and savagery of the battle that had proceeded
it. A tremendous amount of debris and wreckage tumbled about, but now
guns on both sides were silent. It was as if they had all at once
reached a stalemate.</P>

Dodds slowed and looked
about from his run to see a number of flailing bodies tumbling out
across the surface of <I>Ifrit</I>.
A small feeling of satisfaction welled up within him as he made out
what appeared to be the unprotected body of Hawke amongst them. In
their current state, Dodds gave them all only a couple of minutes
before they succumbed to the vacuum; although, after what he had
witnessed back at Arlos he would not be surprised if they survived a
little past that. Whatever it was, they would not last very long.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
As he continued to
watch the bodies floating along, Dodds became aware that he was no
longer being fired upon; and nor was anyone else. The enemy forces
had ceased their attack on him, the other <I>Knights</I>,
and <I>Griffin</I>,
and were instead milling around close to where the bodies tumbled. He
remained where he was, watching the Imperial and stolen Confederation
fighters breaking away and turning back towards <I>Ifrit</I>
and <I>Dragon</I>.
He saw a Ray ahead of him slow, turn and accelerate away, without any
intimidation of the ATAF before it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“What's
going on?” It was Kelly, sounding quite bewildered. “Why did they
stop attacking?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I... I don't
know,” Estelle said, sounding just as bemused by what was
occurring.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“They're
worried about hitting Zackaria,” Chaz said. “They don't
want to risk their leader being killed by a stray shot.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Speaking of which,
good shooting, Dodds,” Enrique said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, good shooting,”
Estelle added.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds had half expected
her to lecture him, but his wing leader had decided to pass on the
verbal slap. He brought his ATAF down to where Hawke and Zackaria
tumbled, reducing his speed to that of a crawl so that he could
examine the bodies up close. He moved unopposed, passing by an
Imperial fighter so close that he could see the occupant within the
craft. The pilot, clothed in black and wearing a dark helmet with
ruby-red eyes, paid him no attention whatsoever, their focus on the
commodore and admiral who were so very close to death.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds came within just
a few meters of Hawke, seeing the commodore's
face contorted in a mixture of pain and disbelief. Even with the
twisted expression, Dodds noticed just how smooth, healthy- and
young-looking Hawke's skin
appeared; like that of the soldier whose helmet he had removed only
hours earlier. The man's eyes were shut tight. Dodds guessed that he
had already lost consciousness.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He then glanced to
Zackaria and gave a start. The admiral was staring at him with an
expression that Dodds would not soon forget: something had fought
itself up from deep inside the man; something angry. It was a
threatening look that almost spoke to him through the vacuum of
space.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>My
God! He's still alive!</I> Dodds thought. <I>But...
that's impossible!</I> He then recalled what had happened at
Arlos. So was that. Dodds noticed how, unlike the soldier's
and Hawke's faces,
Zackaria's was neither
youthful nor unnaturally healthy-looking. And though he did appear
old, his face had more of a distinguished and reverent appearance to
it. It demanded respect.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Zackaria never took his
eyes off Dodds as he went by and the young pilot could not help but
think that he was studying him, marking him, remembering him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds'
comms were chattering with the sound of many different voices, all
four of the <I>White
Knights</I> trying to get his attention. He ignored all
of them watching as, in the sudden still of the battle, a number of
transport craft passed by him, stopping to pick up the soldiers that
had been jettisoned from the bridge. One slowed close to Hawke and
Zackaria, the two men being drawn inside.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Commodore...”
Dodds started.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Stand down,
Lieutenant. Return to <I>Griffin</I>,”
Parks said, pre-empting his question of whether he should destroy the
transports or leave them be. Dodds did not argue with Parks and fell
back towards <I>Griffin</I>,
coming up alongside the other ATAFs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Together, the team
watched as the transports flocked back towards <I>Dragon</I>,
the huge battleship turning itself away from the Confederation forces
with their approach. Then, one after another, <I>Dragon</I>
and the frigates opened jump points and sped away from the conflict
zone, leaving <I>Griffin</I>
and the <I>White Knights</I>
all alone.</P>

Meyers arrived in the
Phylent system less than half an hour after the Imperial naval forces
had departed. He apologised profusely to Parks for the time it had
taken him to reach <I>Griffin</I>,
despite matters being well out of his control. Parks had waved away
the apology and together the two men began to organise repairs to
<I>Griffin</I>
and the inspection of the state of <I>Ifrit</I>.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“How are things
looking?” Parks asked Wyatt, as the head of security returned to
<I>Griffin</I>'s
bridge.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Aside from some
minor damage to the bridge, as well as a few other areas of the ship,
<I>Ifrit</I>
is in perfect working order,” Wyatt said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Any sign of hostile
forces?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, sir. We
performed a full sweep of the entire carrier and didn't
find any. It looks like they all abandoned the ship. I'm
guessing they only manned <I>Ifrit</I>
with the minimum amount of crew they needed to operate it in the
short-term. We did, however, manage to locate some survivors...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Have them arrested,”
Parks said without waiting for Wyatt to finish.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sir?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Attend to any
injuries and then hold them in the brig. If they try to escape, you
are to shoot them dead. Do you understand?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Wyatt frowned. “But,
sir... with all due respect, they are just galley hands and...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You have my orders,”
Parks said, not prepared to argue with or hear the man out. “Now -
Is the ship secure?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Yes, Captain. <I>Ifrit</I>
is ready for command.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Thank you,” Parks
said, dismissing the man before turning to Meyers. “I don't
know about you, but I've had
enough of this system for one day.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I can more than
appreciate that, Commodore,” Meyers said. “I will return to
<I>Leviathan</I>
and nominate some personnel to help bring <I>Ifrit</I>
home.” The man saluted and left the bridge, leaving Parks alone to
think for a moment.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks walked over to
the captain's chair and
slumped down, feeling both mentally and physically exhausted. He
planned that once they were in jump, he would retire to his quarters
and get some sleep.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Whilst he waited for
Meyers to give him the all-clear on the skeleton crew he was
assembling, Parks reached into his pocket and withdrew the small
plastic capsule inside. The usually clear casing was somewhat
stained, possessing a light red tinge. He guessed there was a long
story to be heard that explained its condition, yet he had not
bothered to ask the <I>Knights</I>
what they had been through in order to get it. The five men and women
looked more than just a little exhausted. For now, he was happy to
see the tiny, thin data card safe and undamaged within.</P>

<B STYLE="font-size:1.16em;">N</B>atalia
awoke, at first not remembering where she was or what had happened,
suffering a brief period of morning amnesia. She became aware that
she was lying on a soft, padded beige bed of some kind. Another lay
across from her. It was then that she noticed that the acrylic glass
cover of the stasis capsule was open. Fear gripped her and she sat
bolt upright.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Looking out the front
windows of her escape pod, she saw that she was no longer in space;
the inky-blackness now replaced by what appeared to be the interior
of a starship hangar. The light level was very low, appearing
intentionally so. Other vessels, including what appeared to be
starfighters, lined bays, with various pieces of loading equipment
and tools just visible. Whilst everything she saw bore all the
hallmarks as being of Independent design, her experience told her not
to trust anything; she could well have been found by anyone.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She leapt out of the
stasis capsule and scrabbled around for a place to hide. But where?
It appeared nothing within the escape pod could provide her with an
adequate means to secrete herself. To attempt to hide in the stasis
capsule itself would only give her the option of pulling a blanket
over herself. Under them? No, there was barely any gap between the
capsule and the floor. The storage cabinet? Far too small; only an
infant could fit in there.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The tiny cockpit area
was her only option. There might be room to squeeze into the recess
at the front, between the control panel and the chair. It became
evident to her long before she started over and had begun crawling
into the gap that she would be hiding in plain sight. But she really
had no other choice. Her alternative would be to await whomever had
found her escape pod and attempt to fight her way out, in which case
she figured she would last maybe five or six seconds at most. Less if
she had been found by a hoard of black-suited soldiers...</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Natalia sat, still and
silent in the alcove under the control panel, her back to the seat,
unable to see the rest of the pod. As the seconds ticked by, she
found herself wishing she had some sort of weapon to hand. For a
moment, she considered jumping out and raiding the storage cabinet,
to see if there would be anything she could use. There might be
something she had overlooked, despite having dug through them on a
number of separate occasions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>My
jacket! My reports!</I> Natalia thought, remembering
that she had thrown it over the back of the cockpit chair. She turned
around, seeing it hanging but an arm's
reach from where she was hidden. She leaned forward to retrieve them.
The sound of locks releasing made her pull her hand back quickly. <I>No!
Too late!</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
She heard the door at
the rear of the pod open and a number of searchlights were shone into
the dark interior. She watched as they danced around the surfaces,
holding her breath and wishing that she could make herself even
smaller. She imagined numerous pairs of ruby-red eyes shining just
behind them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Come out,” a
female voice called. “You; at the front!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Natalia's
heart jumped at the sound, though she remained where she was,
desperately trying to work out what her next move would be. A short
period passed as Natalia's mind raced.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The spokeswoman then
issued a threat: “If you don't
come out, we will fire. I'm
going to give you to the count of ten. Seven...”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, wait. I'm
coming out,” Natalia protested as she crawled out from the recess.
The voice had never declared they would start at <I>one</I>. “I'm
unarmed.” She walked towards the rear of the pod, hands held high
in surrender, at the same time shielding her eyes against the glare
of the light that was being shone right into them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Ahead of her stood five
people, each armed with a rifle outfitted with a torch strapped to
the underside. They were dressed in military fatigues, Natalia making
out the light grey and brown colour schemes of their shirts and
trousers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
One of the women
lowered her rifle in surprise. “Natalia?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Nel,” Natalia
said. She felt tears start to well up in her once more, her legs
beginning to shake. She was safe; really was home.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The woman named Nel
raised her hand, looking all about her. “We're
clear. Passengers are friendly,” she called out. A couple of
seconds later, the lights rose to normal levels.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Natalia noted gangways
above her, where a number of men and women, now visible in the
restored light, were lowering weapons. It was a wise and natural
precaution to finding a pod drifting in space, the UNF becoming wise
to that Enemy tactic now. Nel then indicated to her group that they
no longer needed their weapons. The men and women lowered their aim,
though they still kept a watchful eye on the woman before them.</P>

“Could someone get my
clothes?” Natalia asked, dropping her arms and wrapping them around
herself. She was wearing nothing except for the underwear she had on
when she had stepped into the stasis capsule. Though confronted with
a half-naked woman, the faces of the men in the group remained
deadpan, as though they had, and still were, expecting to be met by
something far worse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Suresh,” Nel
instructed a man who trotted past Natalia and into the pod to
retrieve her clothing, whilst Nel herself came forward and embraced
her friend. The two women hugged for a while, then Natalia burst into
floods of tears.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“All right, all
right,” Nel said, rubbing Natalia's back. “You're safe. We saw
your pod drifting and decided to risk a pick-up. You're aboard
<I>Cratos</I>, so it'll
take something sizeable before you need to worry again.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Thank you,”
Natalia sniffed, squeezing Nel in a tight embrace.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
A short time later, the
man named Suresh returned with Natalia's
clothes and she gratefully began to pull them back on. The bay was
not very warm and already she had begun to shiver.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Where... where is
everyone else?” Nel asked, glancing behind the unkempt blonde woman
and into the empty pod; although from the look in Natalia's
eyes, she believed she already knew the answer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“They... didn't
make it,” Natalia said. She reached into the jacket she was in the
process of zipping up and handed over the id card that had belonged
to Porter, along with a few others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I'm
sorry,” Nel said, shaking her head.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We did manage to
complete our mission. We hit and destroyed all the targets,”
Natalia announced, and once more handed over a number of small data
cards, containing her own and other peoples'
mission reports.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You mean you hit all
the targets that we knew about,” Nel said. “The situation is far
more dire than any of us could ever have imagined. We've
essentially shut the gate after the horse has bolted,” she added at
the sight of Natalia's face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“How many more...”
Natalia began.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We'll
discuss that later,” Nel said, gesturing for Natalia to follow her.
“Let's get you cleaned up
and checked out first.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
At the news that her
mission had only been a partial success, Natalia felt her world
collapsing around her. She had been through so much, had lost so many
friends and risked everything to accomplish her goals. And now it
seemed to have all been for nothing. A sense of despair washed over
her and she felt as though she might vomit and pass out. Sensing
Natalia's anguish growing,
Nel attempted to comfort her and then, after taking one last look
back at the escape pod, the pair left the hangar.</P>

<I>The Grace Report -
Summary</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE=" text-decoration: none">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE=" text-decoration: none">
<I>The galactic state
that was once known as the Mitikas Empire is no more. All that
remains of their once glorious empire are many crumbling, dead and
lifeless cities. All of these cities displayed the same
characteristics: signs of intense battles, with bodies and other
human remains left to litter and rot in the streets. All manner of
vehicles have been stripped for parts and the bodies of the dead
looted for their weaponry, ammunition and other consumables. The
destruction ranges from street level combat involving troops and
tanks, to mass destruction from nuclear strikes. The only life that
appeared to be present in previously human-occupied areas were stray
animals. Most ran away from us, but every so often we would be
attacked by a former resident's
pet; the animal either very distressed and confused, or having turned
feral.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>Extermination has
occurred on a planet-wide scale, even the smallest of towns and
settlements in the most remote of areas being thoroughly cleansed. If
there are any survivors, I did not see them and it is doubtful that
they would survive very long without core dependencies.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>Although my mission
priorities prevented me from approaching the Imperial home world of
Kethlan, I have been able to determine that the bulk of the
Pandoran's force is still
concentrated in and around the adjoining star systems. They appear to
now be executing a mop-up operation before, I suspect, moving on to
their next target of Independent World space.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>With the information
I have gathered from studying the movements and behaviour of the
Pandoran forces, I now feel I can build an accurate picture of what
we are facing. Unlike traditional military systems, there does not
appear to be anything in the way of a chain of command or ranking
scheme within the Enemy, aside from the notable exception of Admiral
Zackaria and Commodore Rissard. Command is assumed within smaller
detachments of personnel on either an ad-hoc or best-fit situation.
They all cooperate and mutually agree with this arrangement, with no
challenges ever made for leadership. Lower-ranking personnel (that is
to say, anyone below Zackaria and Rissard) could be described as
being ant-like, since they work very much as a team for the overall
benefit of the entire structure. No task is too big, too small or too
demeaning for any of them. They all go about their duties in a very
uniform, regimented and almost mechanical way. They do not slouch,
swagger or ever slack off.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>To add further to
this structure, there does not appear to be any kind of law (military
or otherwise) at work. One does not seem needed since, as already
stated, everyone works together as one cohesive unit. There is no
stepping out of line and no misbehaviour apparent. No-one acts out of
personal gain, but only to benefit the whole. Having said that, there
is neither punishment for failure nor reward for success. There is no
apparent social structure - They do not make friends or enemies
within their own ranks, and both men and women, young and old are
equal in all circumstances.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>Physiologically, the
Pandoran soldiers are nothing short of incredible. Damage to skin and
tissue is repaired with amazing speed; seconds rather than days.
Broken limbs can be mended within a matter of minutes. Even small
imperfections in the skin are repaired, leaving all the soldiers with
perfect features. They could almost be described as beautiful. This
miraculous healing ability does not, however, extend to extreme
conditions. Severed limbs, for example, cannot be re-grown. Severed
body parts such as fingers, noses, ears, etc. are repaired as well as
can be, and the affected area is then grafted. The reason for this
has not been determined, however it is the Enemy's
one Achilles Heel. A shot to the head, through the brain, or even a
well-placed shot into the heart is enough to stop them. It is my
current belief that, whilst repairable, the accuracy of repair may be
within doubt and therefore not within the scope of the Enemy's
healing abilities.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>I have also been
able to confirm that all Pandoran soldiers benefit from physical
augmentation. In hand-to-hand combat all combatants display
incredible strength, far greater than normal. Their outward
appearance is deceptive of this strength, with all soldiers appearing
to be no better built than ordinary ones. This incredible power is
present within both men and women, with little to no difference in
ability. They also display unbelievable dexterity and exceptionally
fast reflexes. In addition, all Pandoran soldiers benefit from
greatly increased height - six foot five inches being the approximate
average. At this time, I cannot offer an explanation for this and can
only assume it is a psychological attribute aimed at intimidating the
opposition. I can confirm firsthand that if this is the case, then it
is truly effective. A charging, hundred-strong regiment of these
soldiers, fully armed, would strike a degree of unease into even the
most hardened of opponents.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>Psychologically, the
Enemy are, once again, remarkable. Their knowledge of how to command
and operate all manner of Imperial weaponry, vehicles and vessels
appears to be without limits. A soldier can know all they need to
about a weapon without any prior experience or the need to practice
with it beforehand. They are able to maximise the weapon's
full potential, whilst at the same time compensate for its limits. So
far we have not been able to clarify whether or not this knowledge
extends outside the bounds of Imperial engineering, and it could well
be that a period of learning would be necessary in order to operate
new and unfamiliar technology. I would hazard that this period of
learning would be considerably shorter than normal.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>They are code
talkers. This makes it near-impossible for us to decipher what they
are saying to one another, whether it be in a combat situation, a
standard communication or otherwise. The cipher code itself seems to
also shift on a regular basis. The schedule for this change has never
been determined, since it itself seems to be subject to a form of
encryption. It is doubtful that we will ever be able to crack their
tongue, and whilst they are all able to speak English, they do so
only in extreme cases.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>Their primary goal
is not to conquer, but to destroy without prejudice. With what I have
garnered so far, we should be very, very concerned about the
Pandoran's desire to press
on from the Imperial systems and into Independent World space. They
are beginning a mass salvage operation and will favour disabling or
crippling their adversaries in combat, with a view to killing the
occupants of the vessel and adding it to their ranks.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>They do not appear
to have the knowledge of building spacecraft themselves, but are very
adept at repairing and modifying craft. Because of this, a large
number of their forces will remain planet-bound for the foreseeable
future, but, as stated earlier in my report, the number of mobile
forces are not insignificant. Unless we can find a way to slow the
speed of their advance, then I anticipate that they will be ready for
a full strike against neighbouring IW systems within the next six
months, if not sooner. And when they do, I think we can expect the
same approach that they took to the Imperial worlds: prisoners will
not be taken, lives will not be spared. They are heartless, cruel and
without pity; the perfect killing machines.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>A conflict with the
Enemy is both inevitable and unavoidable, and for such an eventuality
we should immediately prepare. Some will believe that we are facing
an alien invader, and that humanity's
first encounter with an extraterrestrial life form will be our last.
Others will think that the dead are walking, as the Enemy rise from
wounds that would have killed an ordinary man.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>But as we now know
the truth is far worse than any of those, and a side of the story
that we should endeavour to keep from as many as we can, for as long
as we can; including the ATAF pilots, who may well represent our only
solution.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>And the less they
know, the better for all of us.</I></P>

Dodds ran down the corridors of the medical unit, reaching the door
at the other end and finding it locked. He looked out through the
oval window to see refugees lying scattered and unmoving on the floor
of Arlos starport's
central hall. The hall was dark and somehow foreboding, as if the
gloom itself was responsible for the fate of the men, women and
children that lay dead on the ground.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>Movement
caught his attention. Out of the corner of the window he could see
the backs of his fellow </I>Knights<I>
as they darted among the corpses, attempting to get back to the
airlock. He opened his mouth to shout, but no matter how hard he
tried no sound came out. He banged a hand fiercely against the glass,
hoping to attract their attention, but they did not seem to hear him
and disappeared from view.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>He backed away from
the door before giving it a hard kick, causing it to fly open. It
banged shut behind him as he crossed the threshold, an echoing
clicking sound telling him that it had locked once more.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>Running out into the
central hall, he could not see his friends, even though they had been
there a few moments earlier. The refugees who covered the floor lay
still and unmoving, but their eyes seemed to be locked on to him,
following his every move.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>He started off in
the direction of the airlock, skipping over the bodies as he went.
Something grabbed his leg. He looked down to see one of the dead
holding him fast, the other arm flailing as it tried to find
something else to grab on to. He tried to shake it off, but for all
his efforts he found he could not. As he continued to do so, he heard
the echoing click again and, with a terrible sinking feeling, he
turned his head in the direction of the noise. The medical unit door
creaked open.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>A woman wandered
out, looking confused and rather dishevelled. She was tall, with
shoulder-length lank black hair, and wearing a torn white vest that
was soaked with blood around the belly. Her face was pale, her hands
hung by their side, her mouth a little open.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>Dodds recognised
Barber at the same time she seemed to recognise him, and the woman
began to lurch her way over to where he remained trapped, barely
lifting her knees and dragging her feet in a quite horrible and
unnerving fashion. At her approach, Dodds struggled harder against
his captor. He tried to cry out for his friends, but again he could
manage nothing but a hoarse whisper.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>As Barber
approached, Dodds noticed the corpses on the floor beginning to crawl
towards him, becoming a sea of dragging bodies. All were silent, save
for the sound of body parts slapping on the ground. Another hand
closed around his leg and the owner tried to pull themselves up. He
took the only action he could and began punching wildly at the faces
of those that held him. Grips were released and he sprang free,
resuming his journey back towards to the airlock, to join his
friends.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>He rounded the
corner and saw them standing, with their backs to him, in the
chamber. They were affixing helmets and ensuring they were ready for
the evacuation into space. The doors were already sealed.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>Dodds sprinted up to
the door and began thumping on the thick glass, shouting as best he
could. Still there was no sound, not from his throat and not from his
hand hitting the glass. His wingmates remained oblivious to his
presence. Dodds looked around, back down the corridor and saw a
throng of figures lurch around the corner. Dozens of ruby-red eyes
fell upon him as the group turned, the refugees having donned the
round headgear of the black-clad soldiers. Their clothes were blood
soaked, their limbs perforated from multiple gunshots... and they had
him cornered.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
Pandoran, Pandoran,
Pandoran.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>The words came as a
flat, eerie chorus, reverberating off the walls and seeping into his
bones, threatening to draw out his very soul.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<I>Dodds
realised there was nowhere for him to run; his back was against a
wall. He panicked and turned around. He banged on the window again,
harder than before, but both he and the glass remained as muted and
uncommunicative as ever. The chamber was bathed in flashing red hues
and he watched in horror as the outer airlock doors opened and his
fellow </I>Knights<I>
drifted out into space, their backs to him the whole time; never once
turning to see their friend; never once offering to help him. They
had left him.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>He turned back
around and a strong hand closed around his throat. Barber held him in
an iron grip, staring at him with a kind of perverse fascination. The
black-helmeted refugees began to cluster around behind her, their
numbers creating an impenetrable wall.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in; text-decoration: none">
<I>As Barber held up a
bloodstained, rusty old scalpel, Dodds desperately tried to wrench
her hand off him.</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
It wasn't
me! It wasn't me! I didn't
do it!
<I>he
tried to say. Barber lowered </I><I>the
scalpel toward his belly and moments later he felt the warmth of
blood running down his stomach, as the blade drove deep...</I></P>

Dodds woke, finding
himself on the top bunk of the bed he had fallen asleep on. He was
sweating profusely. He had no idea of how long he had been asleep,
nor how long it might be before <I>Griffin</I>
and the other two carriers returned to Spirit, but right now he was
happy to lie where he was and wait. Although it had only been a
dream, in light of what he had experienced that day it had not seemed
all that far detached from reality. He rubbed the sleep from his eyes
and decided he would rather remain awake for the remainder of the
journey home.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He glanced down at
Enrique and Kelly, who were both sleeping deeply on their beds. His
eyes wandered across the other beds, seeing that Estelle and Chaz,
too, lay in the same positions they had when they collapsed onto the
mattresses. It looked like he was the only one suffering from bad
dreams.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Following their titanic
and exhausting final battle, the <I>Knights</I>
had landed back on <I>Griffin</I>,
where Parks had seen to it that they were given their own private
quarters, so they could rest undisturbed. No more cargo holds for
them. They had all taken a short nap before being called to eat a
meal, before heading back to their quarters to sleep for the
remainder of the journey.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
For all they had
witnessed that long day, no-one spoke one word of their experience.
They ate in silence, the failed retake of <I>Dragon</I>,
the fight aboard Arlos starport, and the treachery of Hawke remaining
unbroached. Whether it was due to exhaustion, Dodds could not say.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He exhaled and stared
up at the ceiling. Today had been one of the hardest and most testing
days of his life. But he had emerged from it unscathed. Thoughts
turned over in his head. Two months ago he had made himself a
promise: he would return to duty and put things right, no matter how
long it took. And although he had made errors along the way, he
considered that today he had done a few things right. He had saved
lives, lots of them; he had done everything that had been asked and
required of him; and this time - this time - he had seen to it that
when taking matters into his own hands, the ends had justified the
means.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
But the question
remained: was he redeemed? Of all the questions in his head, this was
perhaps the one that was easiest to answer: No. No, he was not. Poppy
Castro and Stefan Pitt were still dead, and no matter what he did he
could not bring them back. He had taken their lives unlawfully and
that was a fact that he would have to live with for the rest of his
life. Maybe one day their families would forgive him, and then at
last he would be able to forgive himself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
He closed his eyes
again; but still their faces remained.</P>

The three carriers
exited jump space and arrived back in the Temper system, not far out
from Spirit. Estelle and Chaz woke first, sitting up and trying to
shake off the sleepiness in their heads. Dodds clambered down from
his bunk as the announcement of their arrival back at Spirit repeated
itself over the carrier's
PA. He woke Enrique and Kelly, letting them know they were almost
home and would soon be able to disembark.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
But as the five
attempted to leave, they were once again asked to remain where they
were by a number of familiar-looking personnel, who stood guard
outside their quarters. After being stuffed into the cargo hold for
several hours earlier, the <I>Knights</I>
knew better than to object. Whilst they waited, they sat around in a
group and made lazy conversation about anything but black-clad
soldiers, traitors and refugees.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Sometime later, Omar
Wyatt arrived to escort them away, leading them to what remained of
<I>Griffin</I>'s
flight deck, where the group would be transferred to Spirit Orbital.
<I>Griffin</I>'s
corridors were quite empty, the vast majority of the surviving crew
having already disembarked. The deck was just as quiet, only a
handful of service personnel in attendance. The five boarded the
transport alone, still saying very little to one another.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds wondered to
himself what was next for him and his wingmates. After proving
themselves in real combat situations with the ATAFs, would they now
go on to take on the role that had previously been assigned to the
<I>Red
Devils</I>? Or would they just go back to performing
their routine patrols around Temper and other Confederation border
systems? As the transport docked with the station, Dodds decided that
his questions were best left to be answered in the next few days. He
had far too much to think about as it was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The rear door of the
shuttle opened and the <I>Knights</I>
began to depart the craft, seeing the flight deck of Spirit Orbital
swamped with men and women. Several dozen heads whipped around to see
who the occupants of <I>Griffin</I>'s
final transport were and at once a cry went up. “There they are!
It's them! Look!”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Stepping out of the
transport, the <I>Knights</I>
were met by an enormous crowd of people, all eager to meet the
mysterious fighter pilots that had fought back against almost
impossible odds. With some hesitance, the <I>White
Knights</I> walked towards the throng as hands thrust
forward to be shook, whilst others clapped them on the back in thanks
and congratulations.</P>

Parks watched the scene
unfold from an observation room, reluctantly aware that he would not
be able to keep the <I>Knights</I>
a secret forever. Whether he had brought them off first or last, it
was doubtful that someone would not have recognised them. He watched
as the coastguards – the orbital's security staff - that had been
assigned to clear the flight deck and sneak the <I>Knights</I>
away were overwhelmed by the crowd. One looked up towards Parks, a
defeated expression on her face. She shrugged. Parks made no gesture.
At least the <I>Knights</I>
were safe.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Turner stood behind
Parks, at the back of the room, away from the windows, waiting for
Parks to present him with the data card the <I>Knights</I>
had retrieved from Barber. Turner had waited at Spirit for his
return, so that he too could confirm the plans were safe before at
last notifying the President and her Office. Aside from the two
senior officers, the only other occupants of the observation room
were a team of six other coastguards, five of whom were well armed,
the sixth holding a large metal case.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“How the hell did we
miss Hawke?” Turner asked, sounding angry at both himself, Parks,
and the CSN in general.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“None of the signs
were present to begin with, sir,” Parks said, turning away from the
window, towards the admiral. “They only appear to have fully
manifested themselves within the past few hours. It may well have
been a result of being in a combat situation with the Enemy, although
it could have been some kind of dormant sleeper system.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“If that is so, then
it's very worrying. How many
more could there be who have slipped through the net?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“All the standard
tests came back negative. There was nothing in his blood, and the
retina and brain scans were as expected. There was nothing unusual
about him; he was perfectly normal,” Parks said, repeating a belief
the two men had at one time held.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Turner tutted and shook
his head. “When we pulled him out of that escape pod my gut feeling
was to suspend him immediately, or, at the very least, hold him back
from direct involvement in critical operations. But as you know, we
need every good man we can get our hands on and I couldn't
risk removing someone like that from service.” The admiral started
to pace, looking down at the floor. “Aside from his refusal to
co-operate during the operation, did he do anything else to rouse
suspicions?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“No, he even went as
far as to destroy an Imperial frigate commanded by the Enemy,”
Parks said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Did you get a good
look at that frigate?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“There wasn't
much time. Hawke destroyed it almost as soon as it arrived.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Then it was probably
part of the ruse. I'd bet
good money that it was worthless to them anyway. Was probably
completely unmanned, in a poor state of repairs, and ready to fall
apart any day now. You're
going to have to sharpen up about these sorts of issues, Elliott.”
Turner continued pacing back and forth in a small area. “Was Hawke
acting alone on <I>Ifrit</I>?
Was anyone else involved?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“It's
difficult to be certain. From what we've
been told by the survivors, Hawke surrendered <I>Ifrit</I>
to the Enemy and allowed them to come aboard. After that, the Enemy
started to systematically kill off the crew. We found the survivors
hiding in the ventilation units near the power cores. They weren't
even aware that Hawke had survived.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Turner grunted his
dismissal of the survivors' statements.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks went on. “The
Enemy abandoned the carrier when Zackaria and Hawke were spaced. They
picked both of them up in transports and fled Phylent, along with
<I>Dragon</I>
and the frigates that had joined it. It looks like he's
been held in high regard for quite sometime; certainly up there with
Rissard.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You didn't
think to destroy the transport before Hawke and the admiral could
escape?” Turner stopped pacing and looked up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I... hesitated,
sir,” Parks apologised. He had indeed held back on destroying the
transport, since leaving both men to escape was, in his opinion, the
lesser of two evils. Allowing Zackaria to live would permit him to
continue with the anticipated assault against the rest of the galaxy,
whilst killing him would extinguish all hope of halting to Enemy's
advance for good. At the end of the day, it came down to numbers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Turner nodded. “I'm
sure it was not without good reason, Commodore. I may have acted in
exactly the same way had I been in your place. Whilst there is no
reason to believe that upon capturing Zackaria we could expect him to
cooperate, there is no harm in trying. It would have made everything
that much easier though. For now, it is important that we establish
whether or not Hawke was acting of his own free will.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I will have a full
background check made against him immediately, as well as the
survivors from <I>Ifrit</I>,”
Parks said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We need every
detail, Commodore. If there is even the slightest shred of evidence
to suggest that this thing no longer affects purebred Imperials, then
everything changes: we'll
have a full-blown galactic pandemic on our hands and we need to be
sure that we are able to control this thing.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Both Parks and Turner
looked to the six other men occupying the room, aware they should
conduct the rest of the conversation in more private and secure
surroundings.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Someone should
probably tell his wife, too,” Turner added.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks nodded and
glanced back down to the flight deck, where the <I>Knights</I>
were still receiving praise and admiration for their day's
work, the five pilots having twice overcome next to impossible odds
in the space of just a few hours.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I never doubted
their potential, Elliott,” Turner commented behind him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Neither did I.”
Parks turned his back on the scene below him and walked over to
Turner, fishing the data card out of a pocket and presenting it.
Turner picked up a portable device that lay on a table next to him
and inserted the card into a slot in the base. The device jingled and
the screen informed him that it was accessing the card, then set
about decrypting the data. Before long, it displayed the card's
content.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Several dozen text
options ran the length of the screen, along with options to
manipulate the card and its data. The device itself was little more
than a screen, the surface touch-sensitive. With his finger tip,
Turner tapped the only piece of text that mattered to him,</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-align:center; text-decoration: none">
<I>Operation Sudarberg</I></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
More words filled the
screen. Amongst the text present were sections entitled “ATAF”,
with subsections detailing “Overview”, “Schemas”, “Phase
Analysis” and “Implementation”.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks stood in silence
by Turner's side, watching as the admiral continued to tap through
various sections and subsections of the data. Images of the ATAF,
concepts and blueprints flashed across the device's
screen and Turner moved quickly through them, not lingering long on
the overview, schemas and phase analysis sections. Neither of the two
needed to see it all in detail. They knew what they was looking at,
having seen it almost every day for the past four years.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Finally, Turner tapped
through the “Implementation” section and watched as an animation
played on the screen. It showed an overview of Imperial space. Five
star systems, Mekel, Carthege, Haylahe, Atlante, and Codexa, were
highlighted. They were positioned close to one another and situated
near the centre of Imperial-controlled space. As the animation played
through, the galactic map zoomed out to reveal all of Imperial space
and a small number of Independent systems, running the border. Five
pale yellow spheres expanded from each of the five highlighted
Imperial systems, engulfing all of the Imperial-occupied territory
and the handful of Independent world systems. Statistics and other
various items of information began to fill the screen, though Turner
did not wait to see it all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Good work,
Commodore,” he said, powering down the device. He removed the card
and placed it into a small plastic container. He then beckoned
forward the coastguard holding the large metal case and placed the
data card within it. The size of the case was absurd for the tiny
object that it had been brought to carry, but the data was deserving
of the protection; for the time being at least. Both Parks and Turner
knew that it would be kept safe until its retrieval was confirmed by
government officials, after which it would be destroyed. The security
officer stood back with the others and awaited further instructions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We have also
obtained full combat statistics for the ATAFs,” Parks said. “They
are currently being correlated on <I>Griffin</I>.
I should be able to have them sent to you within a few hours.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Everything?”
Turner asked in surprise.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Everything.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“If that is the case,
then we have all the information we need,” Turner said, walking
over to the window and looking down at the celebrations and cheers
that continued below him. He looked over at Parks who had joined him.
“We now have only one hurdle left to overcome.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Parks nodded his
understanding and together the two men left the room.</P>

A man took back a
bottle of tequila that he had previously thrust into Dodds'
hand. He whooped and waved it around in the air before noticing that
the flight deck had fallen quiet. Dodds and Enrique looked over at
the parting crowds to see Parks and Turner walking towards them.
Personnel stood to attention and saluted the two men that walked
between them, the admiral's
expression one of slight irritation at the rowdy behaviour of the
spontaneous celebration.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“At ease,” Turner
muttered, stopping in front of Estelle and her team mates.
“Lieutenant de Winter, you and your team have had quite a day from
what I've been told.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Sir, yes,” Estelle
answered, swallowing hard, her eyes straying over to Dodds and Kelly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Answering the call
to stand in defence of your carrier, your squadron and allied forces
against overwhelming and uncertain odds; risking your lives to go
well above and beyond the call of duty, at a moment's
notice...” Turner reached into a small box that Parks held,
removing a medal from within it. He fastened it carefully to
Estelle's flight suit. “...
whilst all the time acting within the full interest of the
Confederation Stellar Navy and her government. Congratulations,
Lieutenant Commander.” He shook Estelle by the hand.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Kelly gasped. Dodds'
jaw dropped and, meeting Enrique's eyes, saw the man mouth the
admiral's last two words to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
It took Estelle a
moment for the realisation of her promotion to sink in. “Th...
thank you, sir.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“The paperwork will
be officially dealt with at Mandelah,” Turner said with a wink and
a smile, as the shocked woman shook Parks'
hand. The admiral stood back and began clapping, starting an applause
that ran the length of the deck. Turner then shifted his attention to
Dodds and Enrique, presenting each of them with a medal of their own,
before shaking their hands and applauding them. They, too, were
promoted to the next highest rank, moving from second to first
lieutenant, the rank Estelle had previous held. Kelly followed suit
not long thereafter and then the two men came to Chaz.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Congratulations, Mr
Koonan,” Turner said as he affixed the medal to the big man's
suit. The applause and cheers grew louder now that the final member
of the team had been presented with their promotion. Chaz, however,
was not smiling, and as Parks took his hand to shake it Chaz leaned
forward.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“I thought you said
you had the situation under control, <I>Commodore</I>,”
he said in hushed tones. Parks met his eyes and for a brief period
there existed some extreme tension between the two men, each of their
grips tightening on one another's hands.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“We <I>do</I>,
<I>Lieutenant</I>,”
Parks answered him. The two men released their handshake and, putting
on his best poker face, Parks applauded Chaz along with everybody
else.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Turner and Parks
stepped aside and people surged forward to hoist the <I>White
Knights</I> up on to their shoulders. As he was picked
up, Chaz glared at Parks who continued to applaud undeterred, the
entire exchange going unnoticed by everyone except for Turner, who
had seen it all before.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
The bottle of tequila
was once again doing the rounds as the merry troop began to make
their way from the flight deck and towards the space station's
bar. Kelly passed the tequila on without drinking, something playing
on her mind. Though she was smiling and feeling rather jubilant in
light of her promotion, she was still concerned about seeing one of
her father's company's
ships docked at a port in Imperial space. She would be speaking to
him about it the first chance she got.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
But for Dodds, Enrique,
and Estelle there was nothing that could bring them down, the thought
of a celebratory drink very welcoming indeed.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“Lieutenant Dodds,”
Turner called, his voice clear and recognisable above the din of
song, applause and chanting.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Those carrying the
freshly-promoted first lieutenant stopped and turned him around to
face the admiral. “Sir?”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
“You did a good job
today.”</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.25in;">
Dodds grinned back at
him. “Thank you, sir.”</P>
